This is the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1162000" rel="nofollow">fourth major usability testing</a> for Drupal, and the first targeting the new Drupal 7 release.</p>
<p>People who were familiar with building websites (but not with Drupal) were observed while they worked through a number of site building tasks. This report contains a summary of the results.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><strong>The good news</strong> is that most of the changes that were put in Drupal 7 tested well. Compared to Drupal 6, Drupal 7 no longer confuses new users with basic conceptual hurdles like where the front-end vs. back-end of their site is and how to create an "About us" page, and for the most part the administrative interface is clear.</p>
<p><strong>The bad news</strong> is that now that some of these basics have been dealt with, we've uncovered a whole new layer of challenges for first-time Drupal site builders, some of which were pretty surprising. Finding modules, creating and placing blocks, and creating content types were difficult tasks for participants to understand, and it's these site builder tools we'll want to improve for Drupal 8.</p>
<h3>Who did we test, and how did we test them?</h3>
<p>Eight participants (a typical number for this kind of study) evaluated Drupal by working through a series of real world tasks over a 75 minute period, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol" rel="nofollow">thinking aloud</a>" while the team observed and took notes from behind a one-way mirror. The participants could phone a "help desk" (staffed by a member of the team) if they ever got stuck and needed a nudge in the right direction, and a number of open-ended questions were asked throughout the test session.</p>
<p><strong>All eight of our participants are people directly in Drupal's target audience</strong>. They are <em>site builders</em>, already using tools such as Dreamweaver and WordPress. They know HTML and understand how the web works. All but one had no prior experience in Drupal.</p>
<h3>What did we ask them to do?</h3>
<p>First, we gave participants a couple of minutes to click around the interface and provide their initial impressions. Then, we provided them with a series of tasks (see <a href="http://drupal.org/files/Appendix C - Scenarios.odt" rel="nofollow">the scenarios</a> covering basic things site builders do from day-to-day, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content creation</li>
<li>Appearance settings</li>
<li>Block management</li>
<li>Installing a module</li>
<li>Creating a new content type</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="results" rel="nofollow"></a>Test Results</h2>
<p>In previous usability testing against Drupal 6 and early Drupal 7, we had intended to test things such as CCK, users and permissions, taxonomy, and so on. What we ended up testing instead was how horrifically confused new users were performing even basic tasks within Drupal 6's administrative interface: the separation of front end/backend, the overwhelming number of options at /admin, confusion between Page and Story, and more all stopped people from using Drupal successfully.</p>
<p>Based on this testing, we made a number of changes to Drupal 7 to try to combat these conceptual problems. And in short, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1173584" rel="nofollow">all of the major usability problems found in Drupal 6 and attacked in Drupal 7</a> appear to be either <em>vastly</em> improved or non-existent in Drupal 7. Hooray! :D</p>
<h3><a name="well" rel="nofollow"></a>What tested well?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>First impressions:</strong> After some initial exploration (around 2 minutes), participants had a favorable response to Drupal 7 and thought it was:</li>
<ul>
<li>"very simple"</li>
<li>"clearly laid out"</li>
<li>"there is a lot you can do"</li>
<li>"not very cluttered"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Creating content:</strong> All participants—but one—were able to add content (using different links from the homepage) without difficulty. Participants thought it was "pretty simple", "straightforward" and "easy to find 'add content'".</li>
<li><strong>Basic Page vs. Article:</strong> Participants understood the difference between "Basic Page" and "Article". All the participants who tried to add an "About us" page to the main menu chose "Basic Page".</li>
<li><strong>Changing the color of their site:</strong> Participants instantly knew to go to "Appearance" to change the color of their site. Although some participants had minor issues finding the theme settings page, they were eventually able to complete the task. Participants also liked how of color changes were previewed live on the affected area itself.</li>
<li><strong>Toolbar:</strong> Participants found the toolbar quickly and had a fair understanding of what it did.</li>
<li><strong>Toggle between the administrative overlay and site:</strong> All but one participant had a clear understanding of how to toggle between the overlay and the site. Participants understood when they were performing administrative activities and frequently used the overlay's "close" button to return to their previous location or before preparing to start a new task.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="poor" rel="nofollow"></a>What tested poorly?</h3>
<p>Now that people can actually navigate and do basic content creation tasks without much difficulty, they encounter other parts of Drupal's administration that are still utterly baffling. This section covers the major issues, though <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?issue_tags=UMN%202011" rel="nofollow">there are many more</a>, some of them quite easy to fix!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drupal terminology is obscure.</strong><br />
 Terms like "Block" and "Module" and "Content types" and "Triptych" either have no meaning, or a preconceived meaning that is different from what Drupal uses these words for. For example, some think of "module" as a block.</li>
<li><strong>The distinction between "sidebar" content and content made absolutely no sense. Content is content.</strong><br />
When asked to create a sidebar block, <em>every single participant</em> went for the "Add content" link. Unsure which option to choose, they went for either "Article" or "Basic page" and scoured the vertical tabs options for a way to add it into the sidebar.</p>
<p><a href="/files/mental-model-big.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="/files/mental-model.jpg" alt="A Drupal person thinks in terms of nodes, blocks, views, and panels and a normal person just sees these things as content, and expects to be able to place them where they want on the page." /></a></p>
</li>
<li><strong>The lack of a visually obvious way to place content on the page was a huge detriment</strong><br />
 People really craved some sort of "edit in place" mode as a visual way of controlling their site layout. They tried to click on region names in the block demonstration page to add content there. They tried to take a node that was outlined with the contextual links border and drag it to the sidebar. They tried to click and drag to resize sidebars. The lack of this functionality made Drupal appear extremely clunky.
</li>
<li><strong>Lack of realistic previews makes building sites in Drupal extremely challenging</strong><br />
The preview as provided by Color module is what participants really were craving to see absolutely everywhere. </p>
<p>Menus have no preview either, only text descriptions that give no visual clue to where on the page they will appear. Content can be previewed, but this preview is shown in the administration theme and overlay, not in the context of the actual user-facing site. This was frustrating and confusing.</p>
<p><img src="/files/preview-expectation_0.png" alt="Participants liked the Color module preview, but expected to see it everywhere and were disappointed when they did not." /></p>
<li><strong>While Drupal takes a "content-first" approach to site building, many people take a structure- and/or appearance-first approach.</strong>
<p>When looking at a mockup of the website they were trying to build, the natural inclination for several participants was to start setting up the navigation structure first. They ran into issues when doing this, because they were required to enter something for the "Path" field of the menu item they were creating, and they had no idea what that could be.</p>
<p><img src="/files/navigation_path_menus.png" alt="If you try and create a menu before a node, &#039;path&#039; is mystifying." /></p>
</li>
<li><strong>These Drupal evaluators did not realize you can extend it, and so Drupal is seen as limited in functionality.</strong><br />
If users found their way to the modules page at all, they did not see that they could add new options there.</p>
<p>Given that <strong>the <em>entire point</em> of using Drupal is that you can easily extend it with modules</strong>, making this fact more discoverable should be a primary objective of Drupal 8. </p>
<p><a href="/files/modules-badness_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="/files/modules-badness_0.png" alt="The list of options on the modules page appears as though that&#039;s all you get, because the install link is easily missed." width="600" /></a>
</li>
<li><strong>The workflow of finding and adding a new module from Drupal.org is overwhelming.</strong><br />
Once a help desk call pointed them at the "Install new module" link, new problems began. Being taken off-site to Drupal.org was extremely jarring, as was the (apparent) requirement to download a module to the desktop and then upload it to the server to install it. People suggested an in-app browser for modules from Drupal.org. Additionally, the filtering options on drupal.org for modules are overwhelming. The search box, arguably the most valuable tool for when you have a general idea of what you're looking for, is located far down the list and was missed by most participants. Instead, they honed in on the "Categories" drop-down, which was completely useless to them.</p>
<p><img src="/files/drupalorg-badness_1.png" alt="People missed the search box, and the categories options overwhelmed them"></p>
</li>
<li><strong> People were unable to make the connection between a module's version number and modules listed on Drupal.org</strong><br />
They generally just picked the first thing in the list, which happened to be 7.x for Webform, but wasn't for "Announcements", which another participant searched for. (Another issue is that once people know modules exist, they want to use them for <em>absolutely everything</em>, including things that could be accomplished through blocks and content types.)</p>
<p><img src="/files/project-page-badness_0.png" alt="A drupal.org project page which highlights the download table as being confusing, as well as the fact people clicked &#039;Git instructions&#039; for help. Oops." width="600" />
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="overall" rel="nofollow"></a>Overall Results</h3>
<p>After 75 minutes of using Drupal 7, participants were asked about their overall expressions. Participants commented:</p>
<ul>
<li>"This was just hard. I struggled with it. I will have my sister help me."</li>
<li>"If you know what are you doing, it's okay. But for the first time user, it is a little shaky."</li>
<li>"A little confusing at first ... but I think you need to toy around with it ... get familiar with it."</li>
<li>"Not as user friendly as I thought."</li>
</ul>
<p>When the participants were asked to select five words they associated with their Drupal 7 experience, 60% of their comments were positive. The most prominent word was "Customizable". (<a href="https://skitch.com/dcmistry/fycwa/wordle-create" rel="nofollow">See the complete results</a>.)</p>
<p>Participants were also asked to rate their experience on a 5 point Likert scale in terms of ease of use and value. Half of the participants thought Drupal was "Difficult to use", and all the participants thought it was "Completely valuable" or "Somewhat valuable". (See the complete results for <a href="https://skitch.com/dcmistry/fy72y/skitched-20110523-144625" rel="nofollow">ease of use</a> and <a href="https://skitch.com/dcmistry/fy7ap/skitched-20110523-144416" rel="nofollow">value</a>.)</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that <strong>none of the participants were able to make it through their session without needing at least some assistance from the "help desk".</strong> </p>
<h2><a name="next_steps" rel="nofollow"></a>Next steps</h2>

</ul>
<p>We also encourage you to help with further usability testing, both formal and informal. What we tested at University of Minnesota only scratches the surface of what Drupal core can do (for example, we didn't cover Taxonomy, Search, adding themes from Drupal.org, etc.). We need further testing to verify if our changes are actual improvements, and there are many contributed modules out there that would benefit from usability testing as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/pic-homepage.png" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="400" /><br />
The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) is the world’s largest association serving the needs of the HR industry. With more than 240 chapters in over 140 countries worldwide, SHRM represents a total membership that exceeds 250,000 human resource professionals.<br />
Each SHRM chapter oversees its own site which acts as a local hub of SHRM activity, providing news, industry updates, and event and conference announcements, as well as a complete member directory.  Site updates are deployed by SHRM headquarters, while administration is handled by local chapter directors, who may or may not have any experience with website management. Here is an example of the new chapter site capabilities: <a href="http://shrmcv.shrm.org/">Cumberland Valley SHRM</a>.</p>
<h1>Pitfalls of a Proprietary System</h1>
<p>The original SHRM chapter site network was run on a proprietary CMS created with IIS and ASP under Windows. Expensive, clunky and difficult for newly-minted SHRM chapter webmasters to use, only a select few were able to successfully navigate the system well enough to add or modify content on their local chapter site. Seeing the need for a unified, accessible, and easily extensible solution, SHRM approached <a href="http://www.saforian.com">Saforian</a> to revamp the chapter site network.</p>
<h1>The Open Source Approach</h1>
<p>Our challenge was twofold: not only did each SHRM chapter need a well-architected, branded site that less web-savvy administrators could comfortably maintain, they also needed a way to migrate old data stored in the existing MSSQL database to the new set-up. </p>
<p>We knew out of the gate that new websites would need to be rapidly configured and deployed as new chapters were founded, and we also knew that the chosen CMS would need to dextrously  accommodate a significant amount of custom code.</p>
<p>Drupal’s extensible multi-site functionality, ease of customization, open-source ethos and massive module base fit the bill as an ideal platform replacement for the existing system.</p>
<h1>Keeping Updates Manageable</h1>
<p>It was clear that without a networked approach, performing maintenance and updates on 240 websites would quickly become a logistical nightmare. Leveraging Drupal’s multi-site capabilities, we crafted a site configuration to keep maintenance as undemanding as possible.</p>
<p>Each chapter site uses a single code base, but separate databases and files directories, meaning that while module and Drupal core updates need only be deployed once, each site has the flexibility to manage divergent content, users and settings. </p>
<h2>Command-line Fu</h2>
<p>The Drupal shell utility <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush">Drush</a> was instrumental in keeping maintenance and deployment times down, giving us the power to automate updates or install modules to all sites with a single command. Coupled with the Permissions_API, Drush let us batch set module permissions via the command line.</p>
<h1>Merging Old and New</h1>
<p>Data migration was at once the most challenging and interesting aspect of this project. The old chapter sites ran on IIS/ASP/MSSQL, and each site was associated with anywhere from dozens to hundreds of members, files and disparate content types. After a several-weeks-long investigation into the best transfer process, a series of tools and procedures were developed to carefully relocate and reorganize the data.</p>
<p>Working with batches of five chapter websites at a time, we first ran custom scripts to move production data and files into a Drupal 6/MySQL system hosted on a migration server. Once any migration errors were fixed, code was placed in open source version control system Subversion, and the chapter site was transferred from a migration server to a staging system. The new site was cleaned up using Drupal, and finally transferred to its home on the production system, where site data underwent a thorough review from front-end and back-end users.  </p>
<p>MSSQL and MS Access data was scrubbed and inserted into MySQL using a custom-built Drupal module, which could be run via the Drupal admin panel or the command line. The module imported HTML pages from the previous system and jettisoned superfluous tags, maintained the integrity of user profile data during transfer, and slotted survey results from the old system into a Drupal Webform-readable format.   </p>
<h1>Snazzy Features</h1>
<p>After all was said and done, the completed SHRM chapter sites were intuitive, flexible and packed with useful tools.<br />
<img src="http://drupal.org/files/pic-admindashboard.png" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<h2>SHRM Administration Panel</h2>
<p>Drupal made it easy to create a tailor-made administration panel that helps administrators jump straight to the most important tasks while keeping the techie stuff safely out of the way. Through the panel, administrators can add and edit content, activate or disable memberships, tweak the registration process, assign roles and permissions, manage comments, and edit navigation menus. </p>
<h2>Easy Site Configuration Panel</h2>
<p>Using this fire-and-forget site setup interface, administrators can choose from five different template color schemes, upload logos, set the site title and contact information, set home page block configuration options, and integrate their site with Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin.</p>
<h2>Searchable member directory</h2>
<p>Provides member search by name and keyword, or by alphabetical browsing. Administrators can also use the directory as a filtering tool to send out mass emails to their member base, or only to certain member categories.</p>
<h2>Customizable Member Profiles</h2>
<p>While SHRM global requires that certain profile data be gathered on each member, local branches wanted the ability to add their own fields to member profiles. The Drupal <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/profile">Profile module</a> was adapted to give administrators the power to define customized profile fields for their members, while allowing members to choose whether fields are private or publicly viewable in the member directory.</p>
<h2>Paypal Integration</h2>
<p>Chapter administrators are able to seamlessly accept donations and event registration payments via Paypal.</p>
<h2>Meetings &amp; Events Management</h2>
<p>Admins were given an easy way to keep their members abreast of SHRM’s busy conference schedule with custom event content types automatically hooked in to collapsible home page blocks. </p>
<h2>Forms &amp; Surveys</h2>
<p>The forms and surveys feature lets administrators gather, store, sort and download data from members and non-members.  </p>
<h2>Training Center</h2>
<p>A detailed, all-encompassing built-in training center was created and included on each chapter site, with dozens of video tutorials and articles to help new administrators perform common tasks.</p>
<h1>Notable Contributed Modules</h1>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate">Backup and Migrate</a> - Simplified the process of migrating databases from development, staging and production environments, particularly useful in that it fully supports Drush integration.<br />
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/calendar">Calendar</a> – This module came in handy in the creation of a custom events calendar for SHRM conferences and chapter meetings.<br />
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/ckeditor">CKeditor</a> and CKfinder – A powerful WYSIWYG library and interface.<br />
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/private">Private</a> – Node access control for members-only content.<br />
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/scheduler">Scheduler</a> – Future-dating content publishing and unpublishing.</p>
<h1>Infrastructure</h1>

<h1>Accomplishing the Work</h1>
<p>At Saforian we believe in open source software and have promoted it since our inception. Drupal has played a significant role in allowing us to continue to create flexible, web-based user experiences that foster great visual design and efficient, easy-to-use functionality. It has become our go-to CMS system.</p>
<p>This particular project utilized a team of five individuals with the majority of the development effort being handled by a single, senior-level developer. We had several work streams running simultaneously to ensure an on-time release. Strategy and back-end architecture work started the project, with design and production work following and then full development and migration to finalize.</p>
<p>Our information architect and designers worked initially to define the structure, content hierarchies and overall design styling. An interactive prototype was created to support testing and to serve as a vehicle for gathering feedback from stakeholders and chapter members. Once the design was approved, we quickly moved into our development efforts, which included front-end HTML template production work; Drupal theme integration; module development and configuration; and complete migration exercises.</p>

It was built on top of Drupal, with the idea behind it being to provide an editing interface that is so simple, even an adult could use it. This is a explanation of what we did and how we went about doing it (and why).</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.spoon.com.au" rel="nofollow">Spoon Media</a> has been building Drupal sites for the last 6 years. We generally do mid to large size projects and pretty quickly we noticed how often we were turning away business from companies with modest budgets. That wasn't great for them, because most low budget web solutions are pretty ordinary and it also meant we were sending small jobs elsewhere. This was the main motivation for building Pagebuild - we wanted to let small business get a great website at a inexpensive price but still retain a high standard of product.</p>
<h2>High Level Architecture</h2>
<p>Pagebuild as a product consists of two main systems which we've dubbed <em>front-end</em> and <em>back-end</em>.</p>
<p>The front-end is the software that allows customers to edit their Pagebuild site. This consists of a series of custom Drupal modules and a whole lot of JavaScript that provides the easy to use WYSIWYG experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_new_site_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_new_site_thumb.png" class="right" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<p>The back-end is the software that allows customers to signup, create and manage their websites. <a href="http://aegirproject.org" rel="nofollow">Aegir</a> is used to provision and manage sites and custom Drupal modules provide a simple customer interface to the site provisioning and management process, as well as the standard account and billing settings.</p>
<p>Both the front-end and back-end are powered by their own Aegir platforms.</p>
<p>Of course we use a bunch of great Drupal community modules across both systems. More on that follows.</p>
<h2>Front-end</h2>
<p>In order to provide an incredibly simple site editing interface it was clear from the beginning that the bulk of the work on the front-end would involve using JavaScript to implement the desired UX.</p>
<p><a href="http://jquery.com" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://jqueryui.com" rel="nofollow">jQuery UI</a> and a series of jQuery plugins are used extensively.</p>
<p>I'll explain the motivations and provide some light implementation details for selected features.</p>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>It was very important for us that the editor was truly WYSIWYG. It wasn't enough that a heading was a heading and bolded text was bold. We needed headings to be styled exactly the same whether the user is editing a content area or viewing it. As a result we threw out the idea of using IFrame based WYSIWYG editors such as CKEditor or TinyMCE.</p>
<p>Another requirement was that users should be able to freely drag and drop images from our Media Manager into the content area. Doing this with an IFrame based editor was not possible.</p>
<p>After much back and forth we settled on Twoism's <a href="https://github.com/twoism/reviser" rel="nofollow">reviser</a> as the base for the WYSIWYG editor. I say base, as significant Pagebuild specific changes were made in order to get it work just so.</p>
<p>The result is that we are able to provide a true WYSIWYG editing experience that is completely tailored to the Pagebuild Way.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_content_area_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_content_area_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<p>One of coolest features of Pagebuild's editing would have to be the ability to drag images from the Media Manager toolbar and drop them into the content area at a position that makes sense visually. Unlike other drag and drop solutions in web WYSIWYGs, Pagebuild won't allow you drop an image in the middle of a sentence. With jQuery UI's <em>sortable</em> plugin we are able to force the image to be moved around the content area and dropped in sensible drop zones.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_image_dragging_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_image_dragging_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<h2>Blocks and regions</h2>
<p>Of course it's not enough for users to be able to edit the main content area. In order to allow the user to create unique and flexible page layouts we leverage Drupal's regions and blocks to make this happen.</p>
<p>When editing a page regions can be shown or hidden, and blocks can be added to regions. This all happens via AJAX, and creating/editing/deleting blocks happens on the page itself to prevent interrupting the editing experience. As an added bonus existing blocks can be dragged from one region to another.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_block_dragging_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_block_dragging_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>We provide a number of free themes for customers to choose from. All Pagebuild themes are <a href="http://drupal.org/project/zen" rel="nofollow">Zen</a> subthemes. On top of being a great base for our themes it was required in order for our JavaScript to work, as we need all DOM classes and IDs to be consistent across themes.</p>
<p>When a user selects a theme from the Switch theme toolbar we simply set that theme to be the default for all users, and make sure the block visibility remains the same.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_theme_switcher_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_theme_switcher_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<p>I'll talk more about how themes are put together a below.</p>
<h2>Back-end</h2>
<p>Where the front-end development was largely JavaScript backed up by Drupal modules to make the magic happen, the back-end is true to its name in being largely the work of Aegir and custom Drupal modules.</p>
<h2>Provisioning</h2>
<p>From a customer's perspective the Pagebuild adventure begins with sign-up. Here we capture the customer's details, process the payment and provision the site.</p>
<p>We use Aegir to provision new sites automagically when the customer has finished signing up. Aegir, being as wonderful as it is, makes this incredibly simple. All you need to do is create a node of type site, and it will be added to Aegir's task queue.</p>
<p>After sign-up the customer is automatically logged in and presented with the Pagebuild Dashboard. Once the site has been provisioned (which usually happens inside of 60 seconds) they can login to it and start editing right away.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_dashboard_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_dashboard_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<p>In order to implement a Single Sign On the back-end acts as an OpenID provider. Our custom Drupal install profile adds an entry into the <em>authmap</em> table allowing them to login to their site without having to re-enter their login details.</p>
<p>The custom Drupal install profile on the front-end communicates with the back-end database to setup themes, roles, filters, pathauto and imagecache settings, amongst other things.</p>
<p>Once a customer has signed up they can add new sites to their subscription with a simple single page form.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_new_site_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_new_site_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<h2>Domain settings</h2>
<p>When a customer first signs up they are asked to enter a subdomain for their website. Initially the site is provisioned as <em>example.pagebuild.net</em>.</p>
<p>Once the site is provisioned though, the customer has the option to use any domain of their choosing for their site.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_domain_settings_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_domain_settings_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<p>Again Aegir makes this very simple. When the customer submits the form we check that the domain they have specified points to our IP address. This prevents the site from being unreachable if the A record doesn't match. Once we've checked the A record points to the correct IP address we create a <em>migrate</em> task in Aegir, which goes off and renames the site.</p>
<p>Thanks Aegir!</p>
<h2>Theme editor</h2>
<p>Customers are able to choose from a set of free themes or they can make their own theme.</p>
<p>Using one of our themes as a starting point, the user can alter every aspect of the design from their browser. They can then save their theme with a new name, effectively forking it from the pre built theme we provided. This concept is used in both Drupal Gardens and in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/sweaver" rel="nofollow">Sweaver</a> module, however both of those implementations allow so much freedom as to be confusing to a non technical user. We have taken the concept and made it harder to do silly things to your theme by restricting what HTML elements you can actually modify. Whilst this limits the power of the theme editor, on the whole it results in a better theme when used by a novice.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_theme_editor.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_theme_editor_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<h2>Custom themes</h2>
<p>While we provide free themes for customers to use on their site, we also provide them with a service whereby they can purchase a customised design. This is not automated and involves the customer talking with a designer to get a result.</p>
<p>In order to greatly simplify the process of creating themes for Pagebuild we implemented a simple templating language that allows designers to write minimal HTML and as much CSS as they require to get the look right. Each theme only requires a single theme template. This is about all it needs to be:</p>
<p>
<div class="codeblock"><div class="codeblock"><code>[START]<br />[REGION:header]<br />[NAVIGATION]<br />&lt;!-- #masthead, #masthead-inner --&gt;<br />&lt;div id=&quot;masthead&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;div id=&quot;masthead-inner&quot; class=&quot;clear-block&quot;&gt;<br />[LOGO]<br />[SITENAME]<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;!-- /#masthead-inner, /#masthead--&gt;<br />&lt;!-- #main, #main-inner --&gt;<br />&lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;div id=&quot;main-inner&quot; class=&quot;clear-block&quot;&gt;<br />[BREADCRUMB]<br />&lt;!-- #content, #content-inner --&gt;<br />&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;div id=&quot;content-inner&quot;&gt;<br />[REGION:top]<br />[PAGENAME]<br />[CONTENT]<br />[REGION:bottom]<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;!-- /#content-inner, /#content--&gt;<br />[REGION:left]<br />[REGION:right]<br />&lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt; <br />&lt;!-- /#main-inner, /#main--&gt;<br />[REGION:footer] <br />[END]</code></div></div>
</p>
<p>Using the token module we replace the Pagebuild theme tags with the Zen markup required to make sure the theme works with the Pagebuild editor.</p>
<p>Designers upload the template file, a CSS file and whatever images are required and a complete Zen subtheme is automatically generated and copied into <em>sites/all/themes</em> ready for use.</p>
<p>The permissions on individual theme nodes ensures the theme is available only to the customer who purchased it.</p>
<p>Custom themes are currently only available to designers we have an existing relationship with. In the future we plan to open this feature up to more designers. Further down the track we will open the feature  to customers themselves.</p>
<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Initially we tried using Ubercart, uc_recurring and various payment modules for the checkout and subscription payments. It turned out this added an unnecessary layer of complexity to the system. The Ubercart product wasn't meshing well with the existing Aegir and Pagebuild CCK types. Eventually we replaced the whole thing with a simpler custom built payment and subscription module.</p>
<p>The uc_hosting module to integrate Aegir and Ubercart looks promising, but we needed to move quickly, and rolling our own system allowed us to do that. Another benefit is that the payment system is tightly integrated with the rest of the Pagebuild system. This allowed us to do exactly what we need to do without working around the assumptions inherent in Ubercart, uc_recurring and the payment modules.</p>
<h2>Main challenges</h2>
<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>The the first half of development we aimed to support IE7+ for page editing. After considerable effort we decided to ditch native IE support, and instead create a simple UX for the customer to install <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/" rel="nofollow">Google Chrome Frame</a>.</p>
<p>We are really pushing the limit of WebKit and Gecko browsers when it comes to building WYSIWYGs, and we decided that a superior experience was preferable to a lowest-common-denominator one.</p>
<p>The UX we provide for customers to install GCF is as simple as possible, and we doubt it will deter customers.</p>
<p>Of course, GCF is only required for customers when editing their site. We support IE6+ as well as the proper browsers when viewing Pagebuild sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_google_chrome_frame_0.png" rel="nofollow"><img class="right" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/pagebuild_google_chrome_frame_thumb_0.png" width="300px" height="200px"></a></p>
<h3>Content editable</h3>
<p>Instead of using an IFrame based WYSIWYG editor we decided to use a feature of some browsers called <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/execCommand.html" rel="nofollow">content editable</a>.</p>
<p>While we believe this provides a superior editing experience, the cost is in the fact that it is not uniformly supported across all browsers. Worse, some implementations are particularly bad. Anecdote alert: In order to fix a bug caused by Firefox's implementation of document.execCommand we were forced to build a debug binary of Firefox and step through the rendering code in gdb.</p>
<p>Despite the additional effort required in rolling our own WYSIWYG editor, we are very happy with the experience we've managed to produce.</p>

Melissa’s scope, focus, and competence [editor’s note: a dreadful understatement!] continue to amaze everyone, and she is generally accepted as a fundamental reason that the Git Migration was completed on schedule and to such great reception.</p>
<p>Hailing from a small Alaska town with a background in education, Melissa is now officially co-lead of the Git Project with Sam Boyer. Randy Fay, Sam Boyer, and the entire Git migration team have nominated Melissa in honor of her incredible contribution.</p>
<p>To get to know her a little better, we asked Melissa a few questions:</p>
<h2>How did you get involved in Drupal? Seems like it was a while ago...</h2>
<p>I needed a solution for managing information in a public way. I tried Postnuke, but it was a complete #fail. Some very interesting friends recommended Mambo (now Joomla) and Drupal.</p>
<p>In the early years I wasn't involved in the wider community - I just got my own work done in the issue queue and forums. When I moved to Portland, I got involved in the Drupal User Group, and when Andrew Morton (drewish) left town, he left me and Jonathan Hedstrom (jhedstrom) in charge of it. I'm still doing that.</p>
<h2>How did you end up being the Git Migration project manager?</h2>
<p>I had been project managing and site building for some time and was ready for a change. Chris Strahl had planned to manage the Git project, but got hired by Acquia and disappeared to Africa. Same basic kind of thing, he was leaving town and asked me if I knew anyone who might take it on. :-) I thought it seemed like an interesting problem to solve, so I signed on.</p>
<p>I guess I have a habit of standing around and looking approachable. And people hand big projects to me.<br />
[Editor's note: And she seems to do quite well with them.]</p>
<h2>At Drupalcon, Chicago you and Michael Halstead had the highest-profile wedding ever held at a Drupalcon. Can you tell us a little about how that came about?</h2>
<p>Michael and I had been a couple for several years, and we’d talked about marriage. After the Git migration, we felt if we can get through the Git migration together, we can survive anything. And we had lots of friends there. Just the week before Drupalcon, we decided to go for it.</p>

Eliza and Michael's wedding at DrupalCon Chicago, March 8, 2011</p>
<h2>How did you come to have the obvious project management skills you have? Is that your profession?</h2>
<p>My formal background and education are in teaching, where I did mostly project-based learning. You take on real things that you try to accomplish and then learn by doing them. When I was teaching technology, the "Cyberpunk MOO" class was the most fun I ever had. My students, many of whom loathed their English classes, were able to earn language arts credits to read William Gibson novels and then build a MOO loosely in the style of those novels. [Editor’s note: A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO" rel="nofollow">MOO</a> is “a text-based on-line virtual reality system to which multiple users (players) are connected at the same time," if you're not hip enough to know that already.]</p>
<p>I’ve been building web sites and managing web development projects for the better part of the last 10 years, though.</p>
<h2>Is it true that you brought former students into the Git migration project?</h2>
<p>I have former students with myriad tech backgrounds, and it was awesome to be able to work with two of them again on this project. It’s been a pleasure to keep in touch with former students and follow their progress and success, and on occasion, work together to make things happen.</p>
<h2>Tell us a little about your background and your family.</h2>
<p>I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Junction,_Alaska" rel="nofollow">Delta Junction, Alaska</a>, population 840. We had no running water or electricity and lived in a basement made out of styrofoam. When it got cold enough to freeze the diesel fuel, all the neighbors came to our house because it was the only place that wasn't frozen. At 16, I left for the warmer climes of the lower 48 to study education.</p>
<h2>What is next for you now that the huge commitment is over?</h2>
<p>I'm now officially co-lead of the Git team, with Sam Boyer. The Git team is kind of a prototype of the new D8 core initiatives, with two leads, one almost explicitly a manager. I'm still working with others to iron out some of the big technical and community decisions but am starting to work on other things, too.</p>
<p>I'd like to add an Agile workflow-oriented interface to the issue queue so that it's easier to organize sprints, especially work that may cross module boundaries. Tagging doesn't really do the trick.</p>
<p>I'm also working with Derek Wright on the project-maintainer interface in the project module (the part that project owners interact with when managing code, releases, maintainers, etc., on the project page on Drupal.org).</p>
<h2>What do you see in the near future for Git in Drupal?</h2>
<p>Well, there are some key blockers before we can get to the good stuff, the most significant being the need for real, representative development and staging areas so we can have some confidence that we won't negatively impact Drupal.org when doing a deployment.</p>
<p>But then comes some really exciting work, like per-issue repositories and a much more integrated repository viewer.</p>
<p><i>Thank you, Melissa, for what you've already contributed and for your future work. The whole Drupal community appreciates your great accomplishment in managing the Git migration.</i></p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that Google will be sponsoring <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2011/drupal" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">20 Drupal projects for Summer of Code 2011</a>. We would like to extend our sincere thanks to Google, who are investing over $110,000 in the Drupal project.</p>
<p>As always, we had <em>many</em> more projects that we would have liked to accept than we were able to. The mentoring team deliberated fiercely over the past two weeks, and arrived at the final acceptance list.</p>
<p>Many of the projects this year were from <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/google-summer-code-2011/community-ideas" rel="nofollow">the idea list</a> we collected at DrupalCon Chicago. Drupal will benefit from a new exposed translation activity, hierarchical permissions for Drupal 8 core, javaScript testing framework, version control activity logging, Module and Theme Browser in Drupal Core and Drupal Commerce discounts setup. There are also projects focused on improvements to the Drupal.org infrastructure such as including git infrastructure compatible with Drupal's auth mechanism.</p>
<p>Some of Drupal's major contributed modules will also gain, including extending the current "Materialized Views" API, help Aegir move to a 2.0 release, improving rules 2 etc.</p>
<p>If you would like to keep up to date on Summer of Code happenings, would like to volunteer to help test students' projects, and/or would like to help students as they find their way in our community, please join the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/google-summer-code-2011" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow">SoC 2011 working group</a> and help out in whatever ways you can.</p>
<p>Here's to another great summer! :)</p>

These tests helped us understand the fundamental issues that Drupal site-builders face and set the direction for many of the major usability improvements in Drupal 7. These tests also triggered a cultural shift within the Drupal contributor community: we now consider user experience design a top priority in all major development efforts.</p>
<p><strong>As the next step in this effort, we are running new usability tests to inform Drupal 8 development!</strong></p>
<p>From May 17-19, the University of Minnesota has once again offered to host a formal usability test in their lab facilities, this time targeting Drupal 8 (as well as Drupal 7 contrib). These tests will give us the chance to see how far we’ve come in solving issues we identified previously. They will also give us a chance to evaluate the new interfaces and tools we added to Drupal 7 core, including the Overlay, Contextual Links, and Toolbar modules.</p>
<p>Attending community members will analyze the test data and produce actionable issues to work on by starting discussions and bringing the problems we find to the issue queues.  All test results, including much of the data (e.g., videos), will be made publicly available on the web and in presentations at <a href="http://2011.tcdrupal.org/node/31">DrupalCamp Twin Cities</a> and <a href="http://london2011.drupal.org/">DrupalCon London</a>.</p>
<p>While the Drupal 7 user experience movement focused on improving things for content editors, we now want to specifically work on making it easier to build out a site structure in Drupal 8. We will test Drupal site-building tools like blocks, menus, content types and module pages. This is an area with serious problems which keeps many people from using Drupal.</p>
<h3>Who's involved?</h3>
<p>This test will be attended by members of the Drupal community including: Drupal 7 co-maintainer, Angie Byron (webchick); key members of the Drupal UX Team: Bojhan Somers (Bojhan), Brad Bowman (beeradb), Dharmesh Mistry (dcmistry), Jen Lampton (jenlampton), David Rothstein (David_Rothstein), Chad Fennell (cfennell) and Erika Stenrick (estenrick).</p>
<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>We are asking you to <strong>help fund the costs</strong> of bringing these amazing contributors together. While several attending members will be fully or partially sponsored by their employers, others are coming in from overseas, do not directly benefit financially from Drupal, and need help.</p>
<p>Your donation will help sponsor an important effort that will help set the direction for an even better drupal 8.</p>

Ambassadors are individuals with credibility in a given area who are hired by a brand to introduce consumers to a given product and educate them about its advantages. </p>
<p>Liquor companies, for example, often hire bartenders as brand ambassadors. The bartenders / brand ambassadors then tell their customers about the company’s brand of gin, and train other bartenders in making signature cocktails with that gin. </p>
<p>Brand ambassadors provide companies and products with valuable credibility. Wouldn’t you trust a liquor recommendation that came from a bartender over one that came from a salesperson?</p>
<p>The downside is logistics. Creating a regional or national team of brand ambassadors requires big investments in recruitment, training and management.</p>
<p>With Drupal however, you can create an online system that helps recruit, manage and monitor brand ambassadors with much less investment.</p>
<p>This project was another collaboration between design and development shop <a href="http://www.islco.com" target="_0">ISL Consulting</a> in San Francisco, and <a href="http://www.clearmetrics.com" target="_0">ClearMetrics</a> digital agency in New York.</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><p><b>The Problem</b></p>
<p>The client, Twinlab, is a major manufacturer of sports nutrition supplements. They wanted to set up a brand ambassador program from scratch, and they had two overriding goals:</p>
<p>	1.) <b>Excellent Applicant Screening</b>:  The sale and marketing of sports nutrition supplements is extensively regulated at federal and state levels. As a result, Twinlab couldn’t hire just any personal trainer or gym employee to be a brand ambassador. They needed to find and screen candidates with extensive knowledge of supplements and supplement regulations.</p>
<p>	2.) <b>Incentives</b>: Twinlab wanted its brand ambassadors to steer people to its online store, Twinlab.com, to buy product. To do that effectively, Twinlab needed to reward the ambassadors each time a consumer they referred to the site made a purchase. In essence, they need to set up an offline affiliate program.</p>
<p>       3.) <b>Flexible Support</b>: The brand ambassadors were to be contractors, working independently in their local markets to raise awareness of Twinlab. They wouldn’t have constant, face-to-face contact with Twinlab marketing staff. As a result, the company needed a way to get the ambassadors new product information and sales collateral (like brochures, posters, signage, etc.) quickly.</p>
<p>Costs had to be kept at a minimum in achieving all these goals. Twinlab couldn’t hire a full-time staff to hire and manage its brand ambassadors. All these tasks would have to be centralized and simplified by an online system.</p>
<p>Drupal was chosen because the client was already running Ubercart with the coupon module  very successfully. This site was added to a multi-domain installation so that products could be shared from other sites with this site. </p>
<p><b>The Star Player of the System: <a href="http://drupal.org/project/uc_coupon">Ubercart Discount Coupons Module</a></b></p>
<p>The primary task of this online system was to identify brand ambassadors and customers who had been referred to Twinlab.com by brand ambassadors. The simplest way to identify or “tag” an ambassador or customer was to provide them with specific codes that they could enter into the system during key transactions.</p>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/EnterCode.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>The processes behind the codes used in this program are complicated, but they are largely handled by the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/uc_coupon">Ubercart Discount Coupons (UC Coupon) Module</a>.  This module provides the ability to input or generate codes that create various types of discounts in purchasing goods.  These codes have some powerful options.  They can be set to become active and inactive at certain times, and they can be configured to specify who can redeem them, product requirements, and how many times they can be redeemed.  Furthermore, the module provides the administrative interface for managing the coupons and providing reports on their usage.</p>
<p><b>Custom Module</b><br />
There was a fair amount of custom code needed to accomplish the unique requirements of the Brand Ambassador system. However, Drupal's architecture and the features provided by existing contributed modules allowed us to create a custom module that allowed us to use existing, tested code from the Community as our foundation, and add "glue" and customization where needed.</p>
<p>Much of the custom module had to do with modifying the functionality of the Ubercart Discount Coupons Module. A coupon, as set up and controlled by this module, was the basis for the Ambassador's Code. Our custom module contained the code that worked along with, and modified behavior of Ubercart Discount Coupons Module, for example to add the means to link the codes between Ambassadors and their Customers.</p>
<p>We also had to create quite a few custom pages, a significant one being a "dashboard" page for the Brand Ambassador to view current status of orders and commissions relevant to their membership.</p>
<p><b>Brand Ambassador Recruitment</b></p>
<p>ClearMetrics developed an offline-online system that would allow Twinlab to recruit and screen candidates without hiring or contracting recruitment positions. </p>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/Profile_small.png" align="center" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>Twinlab already had a large outside sales staff selling sports supplements to stores and sports organizations around the country. When salespeople came across individuals who would make good ambassadors, they told them about the program, and generated a personalized code that allowed the candidates to log-in to a special section of Twinlab.com to undergo an automated screening process.</p>
<p><b>Screening Tool</b></p>
<p>This process began on the front page of the site, where a simple custom form collected the special brand ambassador registration coupon code, validated it against the UC Coupon system, and allowed users to register to apply to become brand ambassadors. </p>
<p>This initial form is a case of using Drupal's excellent <a href="http://drupal.org/node/751826">Form API</a> to create some unusual functionality.  The form's button is tied to a client-side jquery script that is able to call a server-side function to evaluate the coupon code value entered into the field, and give meaningful feedback to the user into a div defined as an item of the form, before the form executes its action.  The form executes dupal_add_js to add the jquery in the right contexts.  This was necessary in order to provide direct feedback on the code via an overlay, without moving the user from the page.</p>
<p>As part of the applications, candidates had to pass an online quiz that tested their knowledge of supplement safety and regulations.   The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform">Webform Module</a> came through with flying colors, allowing great flexibility in defining various types of questions, and defining appropriate responses and actions based on the candidate's submission.</p>
<p>Candidates were also required to put in their credit card information (which was subject to $1 verification charge) in order to confirm their identity and address. Ubercart was used to handle the ecommerce portion of the site.  The progression of the candidate to the next phase was handled through UC Coupon by having applicants “purchase” a membership package for $1.</p>
<p>Upon checkout, a conditional action, configured entirely in Ubercart, was triggered to send an email message informing the applicant of next steps.</p>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/RegistrationCompleteScreen Small.png" align="center" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>After they completed these tasks, their application was forwarded to Twinlab managers for final approval.  Again, conditional actions provided by <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ubercart">Ubercart</a> allowed us to set up the notification system, entirely through site administration forms. This system was optimal for Twinlab because it combined the speed of automatic registration and screening with ultimate human control of who was representing the brand.</p>
<p><b>Code-Based Incentives</b></p>
<p>To provide a proper incentive for its brand ambassadors to spread the word about Twinlab products, the company wanted to provide them with a portion of every sale they referred to Twinlab.com. The model was similar to an affiliate program for web sites, the only difference being that brand ambassadors do most of their referrals offline, not online.</p>
<p>When the prospective brand ambassador successfully completed the registration and it was approved by the staff, the user was granted the brand ambassador role, which permitted them access to content and tools provided exclusively to brand ambassadors.  Thanks to Drupal's role-based user permission system, this ability was already available.</p>
<p>Using Drupal's <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--hooks--core.php/function/hook_user/6">hook_user</a>, when the brand ambassador role is granted to a user, the system generates a new, individualized coupon just for that brand ambassador, to give to his or her customers.  This special coupon is linked to the brand ambassador’s system profile, so that all purchases made using that coupon are tracked.  Finally, all of this information is emailed to the brand ambassador, through a straightforward call to Drupal's <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--hooks--core.php/function/hook_mail/6">hook_mail</a>.</p>
<p>The brand ambassador would hand out the codes to customers. When the customers entered the codes while shopping at Twinlab.com, they got a discount.  This functionality was entirely handled by the uc_coupon module. Through the uc_order hook, the sale was then attached to the brand ambassador’s profile through the association with the coupon itself, and a portion of it credited to their account.</p>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/BannerAd.png" align="center" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>Realizing that brand ambassadors were also influencing people online and through social media, ISL created badges that the ambassadors could embed on their blogs and profiles. Brand Ambassadors were provided html code that would render their personalized badges, which would link to the Twinlab.com product catalog, with data in the querystring that set the incoming visitor’s session with the value of the brand ambassador’s customer coupon code.  This value was used to populate the coupon code entry in the checkout page with the value of the customer’s coupon code. Therefore, by clicking on the badges, users were navigated to Twinlab.com and received a discount on all purchases made in that session. Like the offline codes, these purchases were trackable.</p>
<p><b>Brand Ambassador Dashboard</b></p>
<p>When their applications were approved, brand ambassadors were given access to an exclusive dashboard on Twinlab.com. Simple and easy to navigate, the purpose of the dashboard was to give the ambassadors all the materials and information they needed to represent the brand.</p>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/Resources1.png" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>The dashboard was a highly customized feature that was added as a series of contextual menu items in the user’s profile as defined by hook_menu.  This allowed the user to access these features, along with all of the information and management provided by Drupal and the modules supporting this program, such as the contentprofile module.  Drupal’s hook system allowed us to place the elements of brand ambassador-specific information into the appropriate places within existing account and profile information.</p>
<p>From the dashboard, the ambassadors could download pamphlets, sales sheets, product information, tutorials, e-mail templates, and a variety of other brand collateral. Twinlab could upload new collateral and relevant messages to all ambassador dashboards with just one-click: a big improvement over the alternatives, like sending out unwieldy e-mails to mass list.</p>
<p>The dashboard also aggregated code-based sales for the ambassadors, so they could see how much they had earned through consumer purchases. They could also see who was buying, and through what channels, so they could gauge the effectiveness of their efforts and improve their performance.</p>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/Dashboard Small.png" align="center" hspace="5" vspace="5" /></p>
<p>The biggest advantage of the dashboard was its speed and ease of use. Ambassadors could get collateral and the sales information when they needed it, just by logging in.</p>
<p>The site is hosted at Rackspace on a dedicated server on a multi-domain installation that runs a number of other sites. </p>
<p><b>Other Contributed Modules</b><br />
There are many modules used on the Twinlab.com site.  The primary contributed modules used by the Brand Ambassador system were <a href="http://drupal.org/project/uc_coupon">uc_coupon</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/email_registration">email_registration</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">cck</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/content_profile">content_profile</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/securepages">securepages</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/stc_taxes">stc_taxes</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform">webform</a>, and, of course, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">views</a>.</p>
<p><b>Results</b></p>
<p>The new Drupal-based system has allowed Twinlab to expand its brand ambassador program and boost website sales. Since implementation, the number of Twinlab brand ambassadors has increased and web sales have jumped.</p>
<p>“The ambassador program has done more than just boost sales though,” said Marc Stover, director of marketing at Twinlab. “It’s enhanced our brand. Every day, hundreds of consumers are learning about our products from experts they trust. You can’t buy that sort of connection. And it’s something we wouldn’t have been able to do without this web-based tool.”</p>

(Be sure not to miss the info at the very end about the April 2011 month-long documentation sprint priorities!)</p>
<h2>Long-term goals and vision</h2>
<p>People have been asking us about the long-term goals and vision of the Documentation Team lately. We’ve outlined some goals for the next year or so, but as of yet, we haven’t really articulated anything out farther than that. Rest assured, we will be thinking about longer-term goals and vision soon, but as new Documentation Team leads, we are currently still trying to get the basics taken care of and assess where we are and what resources we have for changing directions. That said, we do have some overarching goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the documentation more complete and more accurate.</li>
<li>Make it easier for users of all levels to navigate the documentation.</li>
<li>Facilitate documentation work, so more people can help and those who are already helping want to continue.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have ideas about what our longer-term goals and vision should be, please start a discussion on <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/documentation-team" title="http://groups.drupal.org/documentation-team">http://groups.drupal.org/documentation-team</a> - we’d love to hear your ideas!</p>
<h2>January-March 2011 Docs Team happenings</h2>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>The Docs team participated in several events during January-March 2011.</p>
<h4>Core conversations and sessions at DrupalCon Chicago</h4>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/bmadore_wylbur.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DrupalCon Chicago - Docs sprinters!" title="DrupalCon Chicago - Docs sprinters!"  style="float: right; clear: all; margin: 10px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>We led a very productive discussion on a new help system for Drupal 8, which spanned a <a href"http://chicago2011.drupal.org/coreconv/help-needs-help">“Core Conversation” session</a> and two Birds of a Feather sessions, and which will hopefully result in an improved Help module for Drupal 8 core (see Priorities section below for more information).</li>
<li>We also presented a more general session on the <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/sessions/new-directions-drupal-documentation">state of the Documentation and Docs Team</a>, and a call for participation/contribution. The video from the session should be posted on <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=drupalcon%20chicago">Archive.org</a> soon. Several people contacted us afterwards to find out how to get involved (besides the people who attended the sprint&mdash;more information on that below).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Documentation sprint at DrupalCon Chicago</h4>
<p>So many docs sprinters! Ariane led the main sprint in person in Chicago, while Jennifer joined via IRC from Seattle to lead the API docs sprinters. We peaked at 45 people in early afternoon, and there were certainly more attendees throughout the course of the day. Many commented and/or signed up on <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/132194" title="http://groups.drupal.org/node/132194">http://groups.drupal.org/node/132194</a> to show their attendance, and here are some highlights:<br />
<img src="http://drupal.org/files/itangalo.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DrupalCon Chicago - Johan = the mad docs infra scientist?" title="DrupalCon Chicago - Johan = the mad docs infra scientist?" style="float: right; clear: all; margin: 10px; " /></p>
<ul>
<li>drewish helped get several new people up to speed on contributing to API documentation. His quote of the day: “Docs are so much more fun. You can actually finish a patch in under an hour” (as compared to doing core code patches). He asked Jennifer not to spread the word about this, so he could keep all the fun and credit to himself, but she ignored that part. :) jeffschuler also worked on API docs, and drumm came by for a bit to answer some questions about API module.</li>
<li>carolyn, liberatr, rootwork, and a pile of other folks worked on the theme docs! They are brave souls, and actually got a bunch of the theme docs updated with Drupal 7 information.</li>
<li>wilbyr and greggmarshall started rearranging some distribution docs to get a solid base for this growing.</li>
<li>gravelpot, mikechase, and some others worked on reviewing the Drupal 6 to 7 upgrade docs (the core upgrade docs are now finished!)</li>
<li>jjkd, skjalf, bmadore, and others got us closer to having all of the Drupal 7 core module docs updated.</li>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/eads_chach.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="DrupalCon Chicago - David and Chach being awesome" title="DrupalCon Chicago - David and Chach being awesome"  style="float: right; clear: all; margin: 10px; " /></p>
<li>itangalo, kvantomme, and eric_sea worked on planning and prototyping some of the new documentation and help system infrastructure improvements.</li>
<li>chachasikes did some visualizations and diagrams of data migration methods.</li>
<li>And more... we were so busy we can’t remember it all!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to all who participated in the sprint!!!</p>
<h4>Other events</h4>
<p>Several groups held smaller, but still mighty, documentation sprints, such as one led by bmadore and company on a bus trip from Minneapolis to DrupalCon.</p>
<p>And there was a lot of informal docs sprinting in the Sheraton lobby all through the week as well!</p>
<h3>Documentation milestones</h3>
<p>Here are a few significant pieces of documentation that were written or improved during the first quarter of 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>Melissa Anderson (<a href=" http://drupal.org/user/33570">eliza411</a>) led a team creating <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/git">documentation for Git</a>, and they rolled out the docs in time for the Git migration (when Drupal.org changed from using CVS to Git for source code revision control).</li>
<li>The <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/install">Install guide for Drupal 7</a> was completed.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/upgrade/6/7">Drupal 7 Upgrade guide</a> was finished.</li>
<li>Documentation pages for all the new D7 core modules were completed, and we’re also getting close to having all the old core module pages from D6 updated with D7 information.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process, communication, and infrastructure milestones</h3>
<p>Here are some things the Documentation team did to improve processes, communication, and infrastructure over the last few months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made a <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1005304">Current Priorities page</a>, which we will try to keep up to date with a list of current documentation priorities that anyone can join in on.</li>
<li>Updated the <a href="http://drupal.org/community-initiatives/documentation">Documentation section in Community Initiatives</a>, which we plan to keep up to date with the status of more long-term initiatives.</li>
<li>Did some editing in the <a href="http://drupal.org/contribute/documentation">Contribute to Docs section</a> to make it easier for new people to get going.</li>
<li>Made some infrastructure improvements:
<ul>
<li>The Drupal.org online documentation used to be known as the “Handbook”, before the Drupal.org redesign. Accordingly, there were a number of page aliases that started with “/handbook”, including the main documentation landing page. These were all changed to start with “/documentation”, with permanent redirects (issue: <span class="project-issue-status-7 project-issue-status-info"><a href="/node/995310" title="Status: closed (fixed)">#995310: Update aliases - /handbook to /documentation</a></span>). Kieran Lal reported at DrupalCon that since making this change (which impacted the documentation SEO significantly), the page views for the online docs have shot up like crazy!</li>
<li>The “Help with documentation” block that appears on the right side of the <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation">main Documentation page</a> was improved (issue: <span class="project-issue-status-7 project-issue-status-info"><a href="/node/995334" title="Status: closed (fixed), Assigned to: jhodgdon">#995334: Improve the Help with Doc block</a></span> ).</li>
<li>There is a new “Docs infrastructure” component for the Documentation project issue queue, where we’ll be discussing further documentation infrastructure issues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We now have topic-based subgroups in the Docs Team, and standardized tags for the Documentation project issue queue. If you’re interested in documentation for a particular topic, please sign up at: <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/125669" title="http://groups.drupal.org/node/125669">http://groups.drupal.org/node/125669</a>, and find which tags are tracking those issues.</li>
<li>Jennifer did a <a href="http://drupaldojo.com/session/contributing-drupal-issue-queues">Drupal Dojo screencast on using issue queues</a>, to help demystify them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Priorities and initiatives: Next steps for YOU!</h2>
<p>Here is what we’d like to concentrate on for the near future in the Documentation Team:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are a new contributor to Drupal documentation, start with the <a href="http://drupal.org/contribute/documentation">Contributing to Documentation</a> guide.</li>
<li>You can always check the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1005304">Current Priorities page</a> to keep up to date with current short-term priorities, <a href="http://drupal.org/community-initiatives/documentation" title="http://drupal.org/community-initiatives/documentation">http://drupal.org/community-initiatives/documentation</a> for longer-term projects, and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1006924" title="http://drupal.org/node/1006924">http://drupal.org/node/1006924</a> for Drupal.org improvement projects (some of which impact documentation).</li>
<li>Another way to find things to work on is to filter for critical issues in the documentation issue queues.</li>
<li>We are working on a new help system for Drupal 8 that will make it easier for Docs team people to edit the inline help in Drupal, incorporate DITA principles, and be flexible enough for both Core and Contrib (see <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1095012" title="http://drupal.org/node/1095012">http://drupal.org/node/1095012</a>). There are several pieces of it that need to be done (in code), so if you’re a coder and would like to help out, contact Jennifer.</li>
<li>Drupal 8: Dries mentioned in his keynote address at DrupalCon Chicago that there will be a Documentation “Gateway” that all Drupal Core initiatives will have to go through before they are added to Drupal. We’ll be working with Dries on defining what that means, communicating that to the core developers and the Documentation Team, and mobilizing the Documentation Team to help the core developers implement the plan.</li>
<li>Ariane plans to do a pilot of running agile sprints (not to be confused with documentation sprints where we get together in a room and work on documentation for a day) for the online docs work. More information about that is posted on the Docs Team group: <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/134909" title="http://groups.drupal.org/node/134909">http://groups.drupal.org/node/134909</a>, and the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/documentation?issue_tags=Sprint%3A%20April%202011">April sprint priorities</a> are in place, so if you are looking for something to help with and have some time this month, please jump in on the April sprint so we can finish up some high priority Drupal 7 documentation!</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for this update, hope you all have a fantastic and documentation-filled spring!</p>

<p>Great project ideas are vital to attracting both great students and great mentors. If you've ever thought &quot;if Drupal could be...&quot;, now is the  time to turn it into a project idea. The project should be feasible for a Drupal-novice developer student to achieve in a 3-month time frame.<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/google-summer-code-2011" rel="nofollow"> Suggest a SoC project idea in the SoC 2011 group</a> or <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/138009" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">help elaborating already proposed ideas</a>
<p>
In addition, you can<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/google-summer-code-2011" rel="nofollow"> help review the existing SoC project ideas</a> by providing students and other community members with feedback. Community members are in the best position to help students understand the finer intricacies of existing modules, and help hhem should channel their energies to meet the the priorities of the Drupal project.
<p>
To help the new Drupal family members, we need some existing community members to be active in #drupal on irc.freenode.net to answer student questions, point them to the correct resource,s and people with expertise.
<p>
If you think this sounds like fun, be sure to get on to IRC!</p>

</p><p>The <a href="http://www.itdashboard.gov"  alt="IT Dashboard">IT Dashboard</a> is a management tool for the United States federal government CIOs to use in overseeing their IT spending. To support transparency and open government initiatives, Federal decision makers also chose to make the IT Dashboard available to the general public. In the IT Dashboard, members of the public can view the same data about performance that government officials use.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In June 2009, Federal IT leaders asked two questions about their IT budgets. These questions are common in the commercial world, but have been difficult to answer in the public sector:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are our IT dollars going?</li>
<li>Are we getting value from our investments?</li>
</ul>
<p>
The answer to these questions is a website that gives insight into the acquisition and management of the federal government's $75 billion-plus IT portfolio. The result is the IT Dashboard, a site built in  collaboration with the government's most senior IT leaders and nearly every federal agency.
</p>
<h2>Purpose of the IT Dashboard</h2>
<p>
The IT Dashboard provides full lifecycle performance information on IT projects' scope and status. The data allows users to see project status, spot problems and trends, manage performance and quality expectations, and establish accountability. The tool is useful to the public and to government IT leaders who plan and manage IT investments. The home page screen shown above gives an overview of the tool.
</p>
<p>
IT Dashboard’s value comes from several facets:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mashing-up data from multiple data sets (IT project justification, schedule/status, expenditures, contractors.)</li>
<li>Ensuring that real-time and complete data is available.</li>
<li>Presenting the data and comparisons in ways that are visual and easy to drill into.</li>
<li>Providing only high-level data that doesn't overwhelm the viewer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Site Design and Functionality</h2>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/itdb-architecture3-1.png" /></p>
<p>
Originally conceived as a PHP application, the IT Dashboard evolved to a Drupal-based application, employing the Drupal API, several modules, and basic theming. While not all functionality is built in a customary Drupal way, we have modified all pages so that they can be accessed using menu hooks. The advantage of using such hooks is that now all those pages can use the Drupal API, and contributed modules, without worrying about whether or not Drupal has been properly bootstrapped.
</p>
<p>
One of the primary requirements was that REI Systems deploy the IT Dashboard rapidly. Since the source datasets were already available, developers avoided the need for a data migration step by working with the existing data model. With a working data model and Drupal’s easy-to-use components, we went to initial release in under six weeks. Since the launch in 2009 active development has been ongoing.
</p>
<p>
Another requirement was that the IT Dashboard incorporate captivating and practical data visualizations. To meet these requirements several visualization libraries are used across the site. FusionCharts drives most of the bar, pie and line graphs throughout the site. Google Motion Charts and JuiceKit power the more advanced Tools section of the site.
</p>
<p>
Initial plan was for agencies to enter monthly updates through data entry screens. However, this approach quickly led to delays and data quality issues. To address these issues, we introduced an XML API, allowing for system-to-system integration between the IT Dashboard and the systems used by more than 26 Federal agencies.
</p>
<p>
Access authentication for data providers is handled by integrating with an existing security system, included within the OMB's MAX system -- the tool used by federal agencies to enter and report official budgetary data. This integration was accomplished by extending the Drupal Central Authentication Services module (CAS), which controls role-based data access at both the application and database levels. The application makes certain data visible to the user only if they have appropriate permissions; otherwise, the user is limited to viewing only the publicly available data and graphics. User credentials are propagated to the database and are stored in a database session. This information is used by the Database Views module to enforce authentication and authorization rules.
</p>
<p>
The use of the FusionCharts library, which uses the Adobe Flash plug-in for rendering, meant that many mobile users were not able to easily access the same information as desktop users. To address the growing need for mobile use, a mobile-friendly version of the website was rolled out using the jqTouch library and the javascript visualization library flot.
</p>
<p>
Apache SOLR powers the search capability. A private SOLR index is used for authenticated users and a public SOLR index with a subset of the data is used for anonymous users.
</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
To support easy scalability and accessibility, the IT Dashboard resides in the cloud.
</p>
<p>
The federal government selected a technical environment that is robust; provides Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS); offers high levels of security, scalability, reliability and accessibility; and has a security plan and existing capabilities to protect publicly accessible web sites that disclose government information.
</p>
<p>
The IT Dashboard leverages a Content Delivery Network (CDN) structure for the public portion of the website to improve overall system performance. Business data is stored in a separate MySQL database; the Drupal database contains only Drupal-specific configuration information, along with static content.
</p>
<p>
The infrastructure was selected to support a tool open to use by more than 26 government agencies, members of Congress, the IT vendor community, and the general public - whomever may have some interest in the federal government IT investments.
</p>
<h2>Module Use</h2>
<p><strong>Contributed Modules</strong></p>
<p>Major modules that were used were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/cas">CAS</a> - Integrates with existing OMB CAS implementation named MAX.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/cck">CCK</a> - Used for data entry and file uploads.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/clamav">ClamAV</a> - Scan attachments for viruses.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/context">Context</a> - Used for page layout.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/skinr">Skinr</a> - Allows easy application of a pre-built style library to blocks.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/themekey">ThemeKey</a> - Eases transition from old theme to new theme on per page basis.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views 3</a> - Allowed us to plug in our own query backend, necessary to access separate application database.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Custom Modules</strong></p>
<p>The following custom modules were developed for the IT Dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Controller - A Views 3 Datasource plugin that has support for aggregations and efficient query generation.</li>
<li>PHP Dataset - Describe data sets for views using custom PHP code. We are using this to drive views that require data from the application database.</li>
<li>Views FusionCharts - Display style plugin to render view output as a FusionChart. This module is compatible with Views 2 and 3.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/viewsFusionChart620_0.png" /></p>
<h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
We learned one significant lesson through this effort, namely that Drupal APIs were more versatile than we had originally believed. Our work on the IT Dashboard started initially with a PHP application, not using any Drupal APIs. We found several problems with this approach, each of which make system maintenance more complex and error-prone:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The logic in SQL queries tended not to be re-used.</li>
<li>Security items need to be addressed separately for each page viewed.</li>
<li>There was not clear separation between logic and presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Upon observing these problems, and gaining confidence in Drupal APIs, we revised several pages to use the Views module, which allowed us to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralize the logic of most queries in View Default.</li>
<li>Establish a clean separation between View logic and View display.</li>
<li>Most SQL-injection and XSS issues are already addressed in the code of the contributed modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As with any complex development effort, we met several challenges, and learned lessons that may benefit others in the community. The most significant challenges included:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reconciling preferences of different stakeholders for different visualization and layouts in order to take advantage of Drupal's strength in a consistent presentation style.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Drupal offers many ways to utilize templates and generic modules to implement a consistent look and feel across many screens. However the quick turnaround and occasionally conflicting preferences from different stakeholders made it difficult to develop an overall design that leveraged this Drupal strength. We have made a number of revisions since launch to improve consistency and we plan to address this challenge by spending more time up-front on mock-ups, and facilitating agreement across stakeholders on the end-state vision.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Legacy system includes a data model that isn't suited to new uses.</strong></p>
<p>
The IT Dashboard has a separate application database that originated from a previous system. We addressed the challenge of accessing this database by using a custom query plugin for the Views 3 module.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Facilitating expansion/collapse of table data detail to suit user preferences (an example of custom display functionality).</strong>
</p>
<p>
Many IT Dashboard screens have custom functionality, which could not be satisfied by the Views module at a basic level. For example, some screens offer a table view of data. However, the desire not to overwhelm all users with the full set of data led to a decision that some rows should offer an "expand" button to allow drill-down capability at the user's option. Implementing this customized functionality required custom coding.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project Team</h2>
<p>The site is currently operated by a nine member team, composed of the following roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 Drupal developers</li>
<li>1 database developer</li>
<li>1 QA engineer</li>
<li>2 business analyst</li>
<li>1 project manager</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these features also empower Symantec employees to quickly publish official versions of forum discussions, blog entries, articles, events, downloads, and videos while moderating and vetting content, helping steer the community in the right direction.</p>
<h2>A Brief History</h2>
<p>Symantec, founded in 1982, is one of the world's largest software companies with more than 17,500 employees in more than 40 countries. The company provides both security and storage and systems management solutions. Their customer base includes consumers, small businesses, and some of the world's largest global organizations. The company's phenomenal growth can be attributed to a combination of market acceptance and strategic acquisitions. </p>
<p>In early 2008, Symantec's Customer Experience team began crafting a roadmap designed to consolidate several existing support and discussion sites into a consistent, best-of-breed community offering. The goals of this consolidation were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give Symantec customers a single point of contact where they could engage with the company's support, marketing, and product management teams, </li>
<li>Draw on other customers experience and expertise, </li>
<li>Reduce the support and licensing costs of maintaining a collection of disparate community offerings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Drupal?</h2>
<p>After considering the landscape of both proprietary and open-source solutions, Symantec decided to use Drupal as a foundation for their community initiative. Symantec recognized Drupal to be offering: </p>
<ul>
<li>a wealth of out of the box CMS and social media features and functionality</li>
<li>the ability to scale for high usage sites</li>
<li>the theme and development flexibility to customize the user experience quickly without the typical lag they had experienced requesting new features from proprietary vendors</li>
<li>a recognized developer community from which to draw quality development talent</li>
</ul>
<p>Symantec’s internal UX team even installed and configured rough prototypes in Drupal leveraging the vast library of existing contrib modules to experiment with various use cases for the upcoming project. This ability to rapidly create functional prototypes further cemented the choice of Drupal as the platform for development.</p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>The project was structured to allow Symantec Customer Experience team to provide input on the design and planning of the site while collaborating with a group of  Drupal experts. Symantec’s internal team is augmented with Drupal expertise in the key areas needed for successful Drupal development.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.webwiseone.com" rel="nofollow">WebWise Solutions Inc.</a> leads Connect’s project development and is the principle contact on the project providing long-standing expertise in Drupal-centric project management and user community development.  WebWise handles all day-to-day operations and oversight of everything from server deployment to administering the rewards system and offering a first line of customer support for the site’s users, all of which enables Symantec to focus on utilizing Connect to serve their customers instead of having to worry about maintaining the platform.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tabsandspaces.com" rel="nofollow">Tabs &amp; Spaces Inc.</a> brings the heavy lifting of custom module development creating upwards of 50 custom modules to augment and extend Drupal to meet the unique needs of building a customer support community around a deep catalog of products and services.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jeffreydalton.info" rel="nofollow">Jeffrey Dalton Design Inc.</a> adds the “hot sauce” of user experience centered design and theme work leveraging Drupal’s powerful theme system to tailor the interface to the specific needs of the community. After the initial launch the redesign process allowed Jeffrey Dalton Design to fully invest in re-visioning the theme and leveraging user feedback collected throughout the initial months of Connects operation. During this process the Symantec Corporation even went through a brand change of their own which was easily rolled into the new theme.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tag1consulting.com" rel="nofollow">Tag1 Consulting</a> delivers the performance and scalability tuning that is essential for Drupal sites with millions of users. With multiple layers of content caching in multi-server configurations, world class scalability expertise allows Symantec Connect to continue it’s rapid growth in a high demand environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>This augmented team approach allows for rapid expansion of area-specific development expertise when new features and functionality are requested while minimizing Symantec’s development overhead.</p>
<h2>Initial Launch</h2>
<p>The initial effort (which took place over 6 months) involved merging the content and users from three disparate Symantec communities including:</p>
<ul>
<li>110,000 members from the "Symantec Technical Network" (STN) running on the Lithium platform</li>
<li>10,000 members from the "Altiris Support Forums" running on FuseTalk</li>
<li>20,000 members of the Altiris "Juice" community already running on Drupal in a separate Drupal 5 site </li>
<li>Hundreds of thousands of existing nodes and comments from these three systems. </li>
</ul>
<p>As of this writing Symantec Connect has matured to become the community destination for Symantec products with stats boasting:</p>
<ul>
<li>3,000,000+ unique page views each month </li>
<li>more than 206,000+ registered users</li>
<li>content base with 600,000+ combined nodes and comments (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.symantec.com/connect" rel="nofollow">and counting</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Redesign</h3>
<p>After the successful launch of Connect in March of 2009, the Connect team spent a portion of the next 18 months gathering user feedback and iterating through ways to improve the site experience. In the beginning of October 2010 Connect launched a totally redesigned theme. The redesign brought with it the freedom to use a more flexible iterative design processes in shaping the new interface. The team was able to focus more on the user experience side of the application and bring out new features aimed at improving the usability of Connect. The overarching goal being: make Connect easier and more intuitive to use and the community will grow both in the quality content and overall responsiveness.</p>
<h3>Site Navigation</h3>
<p> <img src="/files/symantec-connect-nav.png" class="right" /></p>
<p>One area of detailed focus was the site navigation. All site content, both official and user-generated, is created around a combination of content type and taxonomy terms categorizing nodes into “Communities” (ex. Backup and Archiving) and “Utilities” (ex. blogs, articles, downloads, videos, etc). A new site navigation system was needed that would make it easier to move between these communities and utilities and would clearly explain the relationship between them. Moving away from the original tabbed interface, a combination of an interactive two level drop down menus with the breadcrumb model of a site depth path was used to illustrate both the relationship of community to utility, and show a visual representation of where content lives in the hierarchy of the site. The selection of a community and its corresponding utility became possible with a single mouse gesture and click greatly simplifying the navigation tasks. The menu dropping down and then expanding on a per community basis also allowed for the interface to list all utilities available for the current community, while keeping the interface clean and uncluttered.</p>
<p><img src="/files/symantec-connect-utility.png" class="right" /></p>
<p>After some initial user testing a secondary utility only drop down was added, which becomes available in the second level of the breadcrumb once a user is within a given community, making it possible to quickly switch utilities within the same community.</p>
<p>The breadcrumb model then extends beyond the community &gt; utility selection and, when in context, offers further details as links to forum name, blog name, etc. and a single dynamic RSS feed element that remains contextually aware as the site is traversed.</p>
<p>Subtle JQuery animations further enhance the user experience of the menu with quick yet smooth state transitions. All animations were carefully refined to enhance usability without adding unneeded cruft solely for the sake of eye candy.</p>
<p><img src="/files/symantec-connect-user.png" class="right" /></p>
<p>Below the global navigation an authenticated user menu was added with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a user “Account” menu for quick access to account features</li>
<li>a “Create content” menu with easily identifiable iconography and short text descriptions making a direct one click route to add content</li>
<li>a custom “Share” menu to better visually integrate the share widgets into the site</li>
<li>an expandable video screencast help system to allow for in-page video help and user training</li>
</ul>
<h3>Context-Aware Search</h3>
<p>The main site search bar was enhanced making it contextually aware as the user browses into each community/utility. The search box sets community name and utility type as initial facets automatically aiding in search relevance by assisting the user to search within the community/utility category of the content they are currently browsing. An additional tab is offered to easily select “Entire Site” and run a global site search. The context also changes when viewing user related pages to make searching a user name quickly accessible. All of these facets and more are also interactive on the Solr search results page so searches can be further refined.</p>
<p><img src="/files/symantec-connect-search.png" /></p>
<p>The Drupal Solr search results interface was enhanced by introducing facet state icons and subtle colors to cleanly and clearly layout the relationship of search facet blocks and the effect they will have when clicked. Of particular interest on a site where so many visitors are seeking answers to their questions is the “solved” facet, which returns all of the forum discussions that have been marked as having a recognized solution attached to them. This aids the user to quickly find possible solutions to the subject they are searching.</p>
<h3>Visual Design</h3>
<p>The overall visual design of Connect was retooled towards simplifying and modernizing the look and feel of the site to better represent a set of content focused around technology and technical users. The theme was aimed at a more open and spacious feel using grey tones to set the theme elements and UI into the background when not needed and allow the content to carry the focus of the page. A restrained use of JQuery elements throughout the site were added to reduce page clutter and reveal content through simple clicks of tabbed and carousel interfaces. This allows community moderators to feature content through node queues without overwhelming the lists and community pages with volume.</p>
<h2>Features of Note</h2>
<h3>Screencast Help</h3>
<p><img src="/files/symantec-connect-help.png" /></p>
<p>Though still in it’s infancy, the video screencast help system has the potential to be a powerful help feature for site users. The Screencast Help system is an inline JQuery element that expands revealing a set of How-To screencasts created to get users up to speed on step-by-step ways to use Connect and participate in the community. The videos are loaded directly into the expanded element so the user never loses the page they are trying to get help with. The initial implementation is a static set of cached videos, but by leveraging the existing taxonomy system, this feature will be easily enhanced in a future iteration to become contextually aware and show relevant video help as the user browses the site.</p>
<h3>Forums</h3>
<p>The discussion forums are the centerpiece of the Connect community. The forum feature set allows users to post product and support-related questions to the huge community of Symantec customers world-wide. In a recent study, Symantec noted that 90% of questions posted to Connect are answered by other users on Connect.</p>
<p>One of the custom features built into the Connect forums is the ability for a forum poster to mark a particular answer to his/her question as the "solution". Marking solutions in this manner make it much easier for subsequent users to quickly find answers to commonly-asked questions. Symantec terms these answered questions as "deflections" that save the company money because they don't have to be answered by a paid support employee.</p>
<p>This approach to “solved” posts also allows Symantec Community managers to select posts that need to be solved and push those into featured blocks challenging the user community to find solutions.</p>
<h3>Ideas</h3>
<p>Following the lead of other sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ideastorm.com" rel="nofollow">Dell's Ideastorm</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu's Brainstorm</a>, the Ideas area on Connect allows users to suggest and vote on product improvements. Market researchers know that some of the best new features and product enhancements come from the minds of users who actually deploy and use the product. The Ideas area on Connect allows product users to suggest a new feature or function while giving other community members the power to validate an idea by voting it up or down. Popular feature requests -- as voted by the community -- get the undivided attention of marketing and development teams. With Drupal’s improved voting api modules we were able to easily skin the voting widgets for various uses both as thumbs up/down widgets and the Ideas up/down widgets.</p>
<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<p>A much requested feature from site users, Known Issues allows Symantec Support staff to create official notices of product bugs with various status/severity tags and links to technotes in other Symantec web tools, which can then be used to collect votes from users who are experiencing the issue. Support staff can then interact through node comments to dialogue about Symantec’s plans for fixes and bug handling. It is worth noting Known Issues is an excellent example of a user generated site feature. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/idea/known-bugs-list-status" rel="nofollow">A user submitted an “Idea”</a> asking for the basic outline of functionality and over 245 other users voted that Idea to the top of the board. This brought the Idea to the attention of Symantec’s community managers who requested the feature be developed into “Known Issues”. Many times the best ideas come from dedicated product users expressing potential solutions to problems they face and companies can benefit from creating channels to listen to those Ideas.</p>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>Groups are areas within the community where users with similar interests can gather to share ideas, plan meet ups, and self organize to support each other. Symantec uses Groups, powered by Organic Groups Module, to give their more than 100 regional user groups a place to schedule meetings, communicate with their members, and post agendas and presentations -- all from within their Group space on Connect. Private groups give the company's beta testers, advisory board members, and early adopters a quiet, confidential place to exchange messages, information and files.</p>
<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>Some users would rather upload videos that discuss their tips and tricks in writing. Symantec Connect makes this possible. In this "YouTube" generation, almost anyone can create a screencast, and in many cases, these visual communication tools do a better job of communicating a user's ideas than an article or blog post on the same topic. Connect was designed to make submitting these information assets as quick and easy as possible while also empowering Symantec staff to publish their own official videos and screencasts for the community.</p>
<h3>Articles</h3>
<p>Technical users can submit in-depth articles to Connect so other users of the community can learn from their experience and expertise. Connect articles have been submitted by users around the world. Teachers, trainers, systems administrators, and end users have all shared their tips, tricks, and detailed solutions to technical challenges via articles posted to Connect.</p>
<h3>Blogs</h3>
<p>Community members are welcome to post blog entries to Connect that describe their experiences with Symantec software. Symantec also leverages the blog platform to spread information from company and industry experts. One example of this is in the extremely popular Security Response Blog.</p>
<h3>Downloads</h3>
<p>IT departments around the world are constantly writing code snippets and utilities that make working with their enterprise infrastructure easier. Symantec Connect gives them a place to share those tools and utilities with the community. Users are encouraged to submit scripts and utilities they've written to solve their own IT problems. The idea being that others who have run into similar obstacles can use some of these user-contributed tools to solve the same problems in their local environments.</p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>Quality content and genuine community participation are foundational elements to Connect’s success. Symantec recognized this by taking the more traditional user rewards of account status and badges a step further and offering an innovative points and rewards program. Users earn points by making quality contributions to the community through posting new content, solving outstanding threads, and aiding in the general growth of the site. Points can be tracked and redeemed from within Connect for gift certifications to Amazon.com and other online retailers around the world. The rewards program is a good example of a large company valuing customer feedback and rewarding the efforts their customers make to help each other succeed.</p>
<h3>Multi Language Support</h3>
<p>Like all global companies, Symantec addresses a worldwide audience of partners and customers, many of whom prefer to communicate in their native languages. Concurrent with the site’s redesign, the Webwise team integrated Symantec’s existing in-house localization workflows to provide localization of Connect into German, French and Spanish, with other languages scheduled to follow. The flexibility of Drupal’s localization modules allowed Symantec to leverage their existing resources to cost-effectively translate the Connect interface into its destination languages.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As Symantec Connect’s content and audience continues to grow so does Symantec’s confidence in the power of Drupal as an enterprise-class application framework. The flexibility of Drupal as a platform, combined with solid design and development resources, creates the possibility for rich user experiences and large-scale web solutions. Symantec Connect stands as solid proof that fortune 500 companies can combine the robust flexibility of the Drupal platform, with the world class skills of dedicated designers and developers from the Drupal community, to build rich content work flows and social networking features into a powerful web tool sets to serve and support massive customer bases globally while eliminating licensing and residual costs from competing proprietary solutions.</p>

<p>Neil was nominated for the Community Spotlight by Angie Byron (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/24967" rel="nofollow">webchick</a>) and Lisa Rex (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/485222" rel="nofollow">lisarex</a>). We like Neil a lot, and we presented him with these questions:</p>
<h3>How did you get involved with Drupal?</h3>
<p>I got involved with Drupal through Howard Dean's 2004 U.S. presidential campaign. Zack Rosen (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/2840" rel="nofollow">zacker</a>) asked me if I wanted to help out. We started hack4dean, later renamed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deanspace" rel="nofollow">DeanSpace</a>. Taking advice from #php on freenode, we started customizing <a href="http://drupal.org/image/tid/9" rel="nofollow">Drupal 4.2</a> for local campaign groups.</p>
<h3>Do you have any advice to anyone just starting with Drupal?</h3>
<p>We were hesitant to join in the Drupal community; I wanted to focus on our customizations. Moshe Weitzman (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/23" rel="nofollow">moshe</a>) said something along the lines of “anyone worth their salt wants to patch Drupal core,” I think that was a turning point. I had been using Linux and knew how open source worked; the extra invitation helped put that into practice.</p>
<h3>Can you explain some of the benefits of getting involved with the community, and what you get out of it?</h3>
<p>I’ve able to work with great people around the world on interesting problems.</p>
<h3>What Drupal presentations have you made, and when?</h3>
<p>I’ve been to every DrupalCon and presented at many. I’m a generalist on Drupal topics; there is always someone more expert than me at any given niche skill. I do currently consider myself an expert on Drupal.org, that’s what the project managers and myself are <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/sessions/community-benefits-drupal-org-redesign" rel="nofollow">speaking on at DrupalCon Chicago</a>.</p>
<h3>Can you share names any of your other lesser known Drupal projects?</h3>
<p>I’ve learned to not over-commit on small side projects.</p>
<h3>Any interests outside of Drupal?</h3>
<p>I do some road biking and cooking.</p>
<h3>How people can reach you/learn more?</h3>
<p>I have a sparsely-updated blog at <a href="http://delocalizedham.com/" rel="nofollow">delocalizedham.com</a>. I’m continuing work on Drupal.org and blogging about it on the Drupal Association site. The best way to contact me about Drupal.org stuff are the <a href="http://drupal.org/taxonomy/term/13" rel="nofollow">Drupal.org Project issue queues</a>, which I read a lot of.

<h3>Was it hard to decide whether to be the branch maintainer for Drupal 5?</h3>
<p>Dries asked about this during <a href="http://drupal.org/node/46559" rel="nofollow">DrupalCon Vancouver 2006</a>. I don’t think I could have said no to such a great opportunity. I was working either 4 days/week or 3 weeks/month at the time, so it was easier to work out with my employer at the time, <a href="http://www.advomatic.com/" rel="nofollow">Advomatic</a>.</p>
<h3>What made you decide to get involved with <a href="http://api.drupal.org" rel="nofollow">api.drupal.org</a>?</h3>
<p>This was one of the many big projects started by Jonathan Chaffer (<a href="http://drupal.org/user/831" rel="nofollow">JonBob</a>). It has some interesting data, especially when all of contrib is indexed; I’m looking for interesting ways to use it. I’ve been doing refactoring to better support modules and classes. Much of the user interface code will be refactored this year.</p>
<h3>Drupal has recently been described as powering 1% of the internet. What's your projection for 5 years from now?</h3>
<p>Projection-making is not one of the hats I wear well.</p>
<h3>What's the deal with the <a href="http://twitter.com/fakeneildrumm" rel="nofollow">@fakeneildrumm</a> Twitter account?</h3>
<p>A friend registered that with a guessable password, a few friends use it. Some tweets are based on things I actually said, others are just random.</p>
<h3>What's the recipe for your favorite veggie scramble (or other vegan dish)?</h3>
<p>I do variations on this <a href="http://www.theppk.com/2008/10/scrambled-tofu/" rel="nofollow">tofu scramble recipe</a>. I strive to make vegan food that everyone likes, no nutritional yeast &amp; Bragg piles. I make a good butternut squash soup.</p>
<h3>What's your favorite San Francisco restaurant?</h3>
<p>I don’t want to name just one. For fanciness, Millennium; for burritos, El Metate; for sandwiches, Jay’s Cheesesteak; for bar food, Bender’s; for coffee, Ritual Roasters.</p>

We will be performing the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-org-git-migration-team" rel="nofollow">CVS to Git migration</a>. This is the most comprehensive and extensive change to Drupal.org in recent history - perhaps ever, therefore, the Infrastructure &amp; Git Migration teams need an adequate time buffer to perform the migration, verify the data, and check for and resolve any issues. </p>
<h2>What does “downtime” mean?</h2>
<p>The following parts of the *.drupal.org will be inaccessible for the duration of the migration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main drupal.org website, including all download pages, issue queues, forums, and search.
</li><li>Write access to cvs.drupal.org.
</li><li>Account creation on any of the Drupal.org sub-sites, including groups.drupal.org, api.drupal.org, and chicago2011.drupal.org.
</li></ul>
<p>We regret that it was not feasible to provide a read-only copy during the downtime and apologize for the inconvenience this extended downtime will cause to the community, but it’s hard to overstate the incredible transformation this move will enable for our community’s collaboration. With Drupal 8 development kicking off soon, and code sprints happening in DrupalCon Chicago in just over a week, having a strong platform from which to work is vital for our project’s future.</p>
<p>Some areas of the drupal.org infrastructure remain unaffected, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drush commands such as <code>drush dl</code>.
</li><li>Read-only access to cvs.drupal.org. CVS repositories will be maintained in read-only mode for at least a year following the migration.
</li></ul>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience this extended downtime will cause to the community, but it’s hard to overstate the incredible transformation this move will enable for our community’s collaboration.

Today, the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-org-git-migration-team" rel="nofollow">Git migration team</a> is extremely pleased to announce that we are officially open for community testing in advance of our proposed launch date, <del>February 17</del> February 24! Just in time for <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/" rel="nofollow">DrupalCon Chicago</a>!</p>
<p>All of our work is hosted at <a href="http://git-dev.drupal.org/" title="http://git-dev.drupal.org/" rel="nofollow">http://git-dev.drupal.org/</a>, our staging environment for the CVS -&gt; Git migration! Here's how YOU can help test.</p>
<h2>Important: READ ME FIRST!</h2>
<p>Because during this pre-launch period we're also going to be doing performance optimization and integrating new code to fix bugs, here are some important things to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch a <a href="http://vimeo.com/19467580" rel="nofollow">screencast explaining how the new infrastructure works</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Testing will only be open during certain hours of the day</strong>. The <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/119449" rel="nofollow">Git Migration Community Testing Wiki</a> contains the current status of the system as well as rebuild schedules, and a calendar which tells the times during which testing is open. When testing is open, you'll see an Apache password prompt (which prevents Google from indexing the site) that looks something like this:<br />
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110202-jbd8ddjtbrekct8sbm61g3jb2q.png" alt="Apache password prompt indicates we&#039;re open for testing!" /></li>
<li><strong>To log in to <a href="http://git-dev.drupal.org/" title="http://git-dev.drupal.org/" rel="nofollow">http://git-dev.drupal.org/</a>, you must first reset your password.</strong>. This is a basic security precaution for our development sites. You can do this from the <a href="http://git-dev.drupal.org/user/password" rel="nofollow">Request new password</a> page. You’ll need to do this anytime git-dev has been rebuilt.<br />
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110202-b47gx4tfrm1wxfbwyeatceqy2g.png" alt="Request new password screen." />
</li>
<li><strong><em>All</em> users, including current CVS account holders, need to agree to terms of use in order to obtain Git access.</strong> There are instructions for doing this at <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1047190" title="http://drupal.org/node/1047190" rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/node/1047190</a>. You'll also need to do <em>this</em> any time the server is rebuilt. <strong>Note:</strong> Click on the "Logged in as <em>username</em>" link to see the choices below.<br />
<img src="https://img.skitch.com/20110202-q5ac4x7shjb7pqf8ydbxaff3uy.png" alt="Navigate to the Git access tab." />
</li>
<li><strong>The server will be rebuilt every two days.</strong> Each time that happens, you'll lose any projects and code changes you made, and also need to repeat the "reset password" and "agree to git terms" steps <strong>again</strong> in order to continue testing.</li>
<li><strong>If you find problems, please log them against the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/git_dev" rel="nofollow">Git Migration Community Testing</a> issue queue.</strong> Make sure whatever you're reporting doesn't show up in our list of <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/search/git_dev?text=&amp;assigned=&amp;submitted=&amp;participant=&amp;issue_tags_op=or&amp;issue_tags=Known+Issues" rel="nofollow">known issues</a> first. One of our team members will receive reports and then push them into the correct issue queue, if necessary. There is also a #drupal-gitsupport channel on irc.freenode.net for new Git users (and experienced Git users who want to help make the transition as smooth as possible :)).</li>
</ul>
<p>Got all that? Great. Here's what you can do on our new shiny Git architecture.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Before starting, you must reset your password on git-dev.drupal.org, since the passwords have been masked there.</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="http://git-dev.drupal.org/user/password" title="http://git-dev.drupal.org/user/password" rel="nofollow">http://git-dev.drupal.org/user/password</a> and submit the form.</li>
<li>Check your e-mail for the link, log in, reset your password.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we start the actual Git setup.</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="http://git-dev.drupal.org/user" title="http://git-dev.drupal.org/user" rel="nofollow">http://git-dev.drupal.org/user</a></li>
<li>Click the Edit tab</li>
<li>Visit the "Git access" secondary tab</li>
<li>Read and agree to the Git Access Agreement</li>
<li>If you did not already have a CVS account you'll be asked to accept or change your desired git username. (If you already did have a CVS username and want to change it, see <a href="https://drupal.org/node/1036140" title="https://drupal.org/node/1036140" rel="nofollow">https://drupal.org/node/1036140</a>)</li>
<li>Optional: Visit the "SSH Keys" tab and add a new key by pasting your public key into it. (If you don't already have an ssh keypair, instructions are at <a href="http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect" title="http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect" rel="nofollow">http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Creating projects</h2>
<p>With that we have enough set up to create a sandbox project.</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the "Your Projects" tab, which will have have projects only if you're the owner of projects on Drupal.org.</li>
<li>Click the Add a new project link (<a href="http://git-dev.drupal.org/node/add/project-project" title="http://git-dev.drupal.org/node/add/project-project" rel="nofollow">http://git-dev.drupal.org/node/add/project-project</a>)</li>
<li>Fill in the requested information making sure that the "sandbox" checkbox is checked. (If you didn't have the "Git vetted user" role, equivalent to CVS access permission, it would be checked and disabled.)</li>
<li>You now have a sandbox project.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can add files into the repository.</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit the "Git instructions" tab and follow the instructions there.</li>
<li>Do and push additional commits as you see fit.</li>
<li>View your commits on the project page "View commits".</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It's not possible to create releases on a sandbox. To create releases during testing, you must have an existing CVS account.</p>
<p>For those who have existing CVS accounts, you can now repeat the same process with a full project.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Add a new project link (<a href="http://git-dev.drupal.org/node/add/project-project" title="http://git-dev.drupal.org/node/add/project-project" rel="nofollow">http://git-dev.drupal.org/node/add/project-project</a>)</li>
<li>Fill in the requested information making sure that the "sandbox" checkbox is not checked.</li>
<li>Use the "Git instructions" tab to help you create some files for the repository and commit them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Create a project release:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tag the commit: git tag 7.x-1.0</li>
<li>Push the tag: git push origin 7.x-1.0</li>
<li>On the project page, click "Add new release" and choose the 7.x-1.0 tag as the base for the release</li>
<li>Wait for the new release to be created</li>
<li>Download the tarball or zipball and view the contents</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's about it! Pretty spiffy, eh? :)</p>
<p>Of course, if everyone tested the above steps we wouldn't find any launch-busting bugs. ;) So please, also help us find edge cases. Remember to think outside the box as you go through, particularly if you're a more advanced CVS/Git user. Experiment. Try creating a feature branch that doesn't follow naming conventions. Try pushing multiple commits at once. Try to think of weird places we use version control data that might still have issues. Test your own projects and ensure their logs were parsed properly, and tarballs contain what they should.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Are my code changes going to be saved when we migrate over?</strong><br />
Nope. All code changes will be wiped every 48 hours or so. Feel free to practice as much as you'd like, there's no fear of screwing something up!</p>
<p><strong>I pushed a commit and it's not showing up. What gives?</strong><br />
Check <a href="http://git-dev.drupalcode.org/" title="http://git-dev.drupalcode.org/" rel="nofollow">http://git-dev.drupalcode.org/</a> to see if it's a bug with the Drupal.org log parser or a bug with Git.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that you've set your global git config variables to an e-mail address that's associated with your Drupal.org account. Otherwise, your commits will not be credited to you.</p>
<p><strong>I checked the "I agree" box, but I still can't create projects. Why does it hate me?</strong><br />
The form under the "Git access" sub-tab is actually a two-step form; one step is agreeing to the terms of use, and another is specifying your desired Git username (which defaults to your drupal.org username). Submit the form a second time and you should be good to go!</p>
<h2>Help us!</h2>
<p>If you know Git well, please hang out in #drupal-gitsupport to help new users. Please help review issues in the <a href="https://drupal.org/project/issues/git_dev" rel="nofollow">git community testing queue</a>, help solve support issue, clean up duplicates, improve the reports, write or <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/git" rel="nofollow">improve the documentation</a>, etc. We need all the help we can get in order to make this as smooth a transition as possible! Once Git goes live, CVS is dead, dead, dead. Hooray!</p>

We need you to make some changes to your user profile by February 13, 2011.</strong></p>
<p>For those who don't know, <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-org-git-migration-team" rel="nofollow">we're migrating Drupal.org's version control system from CVS to Git</a> very soon! Git associates commits with a name and e-mail address, rather than a username as in CVS.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that you are properly credited for both your legacy and future contributions post-Git migration, please complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide which e-mail address you want to use for your Git commits and update your profile accordingly. [<a href="#email" rel="nofollow">instructions</a>]</li>
<li>Decide if you want to change your CVS username (which will be used for Git). If you do, respond at the issue listed below with your uid and desired Git username. [<a href="#username" rel="nofollow">instructions</a>]</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="email">Decide which e-mail address you want to use for your Git commits</h2>
<p>It’s important to consider the question of which e-mail address to associate with your Git commits. While your e-mail addresses won’t ever be visible to others on Drupal.org, they can be viewed with git log commands and similar. So it’s generally a good idea to specify an e-mail address that you would be comfortable giving out to untrusted people. At the same time, it is a generally accepted practice in the wider Git world to use a real e-mail address for this data.</p>
<p>More information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read about <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1018116" rel="nofollow">How to specify your CVS -&gt; Git name and e-mail</a> in your Drupal.org account.</li>
<li>See <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1018118" rel="nofollow">manage E-mail Addresses on Drupal.org</a> for more info.</li>
<li>Learn how to <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1022156" rel="nofollow">identify yourself to Git</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="username">Decide if you want to change your CVS username</h2>
<p>Your Git username on drupal.org will be the same as your existing CVS account username unless you ask for it to be changed here: <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1036140" title="http://drupal.org/node/1036140" rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/node/1036140</a></p>
<p>Drupal.org will use this Git username to generate URIs for sandbox projects you create (see <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/114264" title="http://groups.drupal.org/node/114264" rel="nofollow">http://groups.drupal.org/node/114264</a> for a summary of what sandbox projects will be). You will also use this as your SSH username when authenticating to Drupal.org with Git.<br />
<strong>This is your only chance to change your Git username.</strong> Once it's set, it's permanent. By default, all existing CVS account holders will have a Git account created with the same username. So if you don't like your CVS account name, now's the time to act!</p>
<h2 id="background">Some background information</h2>
<p>In order to sync CVS usernames with Git usernames we’re deploying two new modules to Drupal.org:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple E-mail Addresses: Allows you to associate more than one e-mail address (e.g. the one you use on GitHub, the one you use on Drupal.org) with your Drupal user account. All users’ e-mail addresses are now editable on an “E-mail addresses” sub-tab, rather than the main user edit page.</li>
<li>CVS Migration Prefs: Specifies to which e-mail address your legacy commits should be credited, once imported into Git. You can also choose a fake “no-reply” e-mail for all your legacy commits, in order to protect your privacy. If left untouched, this fake e-mail will be used. Your selection for legacy commit credit cannot be changed post-Git migration.</li>
</ul>

DIRECTV, Verizon FiOS, and local cable systems bring gmc into roughly 50 million homes across the country. The brand boasts such popular shows as Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Highway to Heaven, Promised Land, Sister Sister, Early Edition and Amen. The website receives about 750,000 monthly page views from 250,000 unique visitors.</p>
<p>The channel recently launched a full site redesign in conjunction with an upgrade from Drupal 5 to Drupal 6. The project team from Mediacurrent would like to share some of what they've learned from the design and build of the site with the Drupal community.</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The old gmc site was in need of an aesthetic and architecture facelift. In 2009, the company added uplifting movies and series to its program offerings to better service viewers looking for faith and family-friendly entertainment. The old site had a limited social media strategy and the design’s navigation prevented it from optimally interacting and engaging visitors. During the discovery and strategic planning phases of the project there were several objectives that were established. The goals included:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Upgrading the current Drupal 5 site to  Drupal 6:</strong> The idea of jumping to Drupal 7 was discussed, but was determined to be too risky given many of the unknowns related to key contributed modules.</li>
<li><strong>Branding makeover:</strong>  The gmc executive team wanted a more modern, contemporary website redesign that reinforced the brand’s expansion to beyond music. gmc's content has been expanding into originally produced movies and plays.</li>
<li><strong>Create a more immersive customer experience:</strong> The new site needed to integrate more social media and networking calls to action in order to bump registered users on the site. Thus, usability was at top of mind when planning functionality for the new site.</li>
<li><strong>Effectively integrating third-party tools:</strong> There were a number of applications being piecemealed on the old site that needed to be unified with Drupal-based solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Content import:</strong> There were large amounts of new assets (3100+ files, 2700+ nodes, and 2200+ taxonomy terms) that needed to be migrated over. During the rebuild, leveraging the core taxonomy system to build rich associations for relevant content was a major desire.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Graphic Design</h2>
<p>Upending preconceived notions about gmc's previous brand was at top of mind during the site redesign. We collaborated extensively with gmc's internal team to make sure new features would allow gmc's content shift to continue without the need for constant feature maintenance updates. This was definitely a challenge. Careful planning was needed to create extremely flexible features that could meet the expected growth and ongoing changes, while still being easily managed. To deliver the new site, Mediacurrent utilized a team-based approach, dividing tasks between back-end engineering and front-end theming. </p>
<p>The Graphic Design aspects took into account the following:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> The design strategy was predicated around three words - uplifting, inspirational, and simplicity. Mediacurrent helped gmc organize their vision into a comprehensive blend of gmc's branded warm reds with touches of complementary cool grays, blues, purples and aqua blues. Transparent circles with thin white strokes overplayed on top of converging spiral circular gradients were used to achieve the celestial-inspirational feel. The overall design is built around "gmc red", which was used for link and background navigation colors. Cool grays were used to pull the entire design together and create subtle areas of interest and focus. The gmc team did not want anything too loud or "bullish" in nature. </p>
<p><strong>Menu Design:</strong> We had to create a menu system that would visually divide each section of the site while still allowing additional categories to be added underneath corresponding sections. This challenge was met by using the classic tabbed menu system (Nice Menus Module) coupled with waterfall pull down menu interactivity. Of particular note is that when a user has selected a section the tab stays active throughout all section subpages. The active waterfall menu is visually offset or totally contrasted from non-active waterfall navigation. This was achieved with the help of extra classes inserted by jQuery.</p>
<p><strong>Network Bar:</strong> gmc wanted to give more prominence to their advertising offerings, social media callouts, and company profile. One other major point of emphasis was the "Get The Channel" feature. We suggested creating a network bar at the very top of the page to pull this important content away from the main content areas in the body and footer. The concept was to streamline the user’s access to this major feature.</p>
<p><strong>Homepage Rotator:</strong> The team at gmc wanted to update the user interface and experience to accommodate more content above the fold without disrupting the visual flow of the surrounding content. We designed a rotator that would allow for a larger lead photo, longer titles and more space for story lead text. The rotator allows for a user to pause and move between slides easily. </p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 15px 30px 15px 0;" id="gmc_schedule" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/gmc_schedule_v2.jpg" alt="gmc schedule" title="gmc schedule" name="gmc_schedule" />Content import can represent a risk to a Drupal project plan, even when the content is being imported from a previous Drupal version. One method to mitigate the risk of a complex content import is to analyze the input format being used for published content and be on alert for a disproportionate volume of content published to a general content type such as "page." If the site has an overwhelming amount of content published as a "page" with "PHP" set as the input format, it could be a warning sign for struggles ahead.</p>
<p>gmc editors wanted to be able to build dynamic content associations between entertainers and associated content, but in a way to make the references optional. This was accomplished by augmenting the core taxonomy module with a custom module that creates node associations based on matching terms between content types, such as an actor to a film. This is unique compared to a traditional node reference setup, as actor nodes do not have to exist and can be added later for the association to be automatically created when the appropriately tagged node becomes available.</p>
<p>Creating a custom weekly programming schedule import feature also required extra effort. The available data lacked the necessary structure in order to run a normal import process. Instead, a custom module had to be created that would parse the weekly schedule file and create the appropriate nodes and content associations.</p>
<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>The back-end management of the gmc site was facilitated through a series of custom publishing solutions and third-party tools, none of which played particularly well together. It was obvious that there was a need to devise a better way to leverage all the moving parts. Enter version 6 of Drupal. The gmc site uses over 50 contributed modules, including staples like CCK and Views. </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the modules used:</p>
<h3>Module List</h3>
<p>admin, authcache, backup_migrate, better_formats, boost, captcha, CCK, content_copy, content_taxonomy, custom_breadcrumbs, date_api, dblog, fb_social, filefield_paths, filefield_sources, forum, globalredirect, googleanalytics, hierarchical_select, hs_content_taxonomy, image_captcha, image_resize_filter, imageapi, imagecache, imagefield, imagefield_assist, imagefield_tokens, imce, imce_wysiwyg, jcarousel, jquery_ui, lightbox2, menu_attributes, menutrails, modr8, nice_menus, nodequeue, noderef_image_helper, nodereference, nodewords, page_title, pathauto, scheduler, search404, seochecklist, share, sharethis, site_map, statistics, taxonomy, taxonomy_manager, views, views_bulk_operations, views_customfield, views_or, views_slideshow, viewscarousel, webform, wysiwyg</p>
<h3>Custom Modules</h3>
<p>We also needed to extend or customize a number of modules to meet the requirements we were after. Those modules included:</p>
<p><img style="float: right; margin: 15px 0 15px 30px;" id="gmc_schedule_import" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/gmc_schedule_import_v2.jpg" alt="gmc schedule import" title="gmc schedule import" name="gmc_schedule" /><strong>Schedule:</strong> gmc wanted to automate their scheduling process and improve the online schedules usability as part of the redesign. The schedule spreadsheets are done by hand with no unique keys for programs This was cumbersome, but we came up with a solution to efficiently manage the process of importing a CSV file to populate the program schedule as well as creating episodes for their shows and the references between them.</p>
<p><strong>Galleria + Node Reference Image Helper:</strong> This extended the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/galleria">Galleria</a> module so that we could use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/noderef_image_helper">noderef_image_helper</a> module which greatly improves its flexibility and administrative usability.</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Content + Views:</strong> The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/relevant_content">Relevant Content</a> module was extended to use <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> which provides all the advantages of a custom view with relevant_content providing the term arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Unicorn Video:</strong> gmc is using <a href="http://www.unicornmedia.com/">Unicorn Media</a> as their video CDN, so we created a custom module to work with their API for the sites video features.</p>
<p><strong>Conditional Node Terms:</strong> One of the workflow obstacles we encountered was the client’s desire to dynamically link content to terms if a node with matching criteria was found, and for it to act as a normal term if not. A combination of custom term, theming and argument handling functions are combined into a module for this functionality.</p>
<p>During the development of this site, Mediacurrent gained approval from the client to contribute code back to the Drupal community. Team member Chris Hales submitted patches for the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1030472">Galleria</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/node/857046#comment-3432814">Relevant Content</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/772668">Nodewords</a> modules. </p>
<h2>Drupal Theming</h2>
<p>To reiterate, there was a heavy emphasis to create a highly professional re-brand of the site, while allowing visitors to dive into loads of data without clutter or confusion. In short, theming a custom site like gmc always has obstacles that require creative problem-solving. Here are some we wanted to highlight:</p>
<p><strong>Gradients and Rounded Corners:</strong> The detailed design elements required many types of nested content areas with rounded corners and background gradients. However, the design had to appear consistent regardless of browser type and Internet Explorer (IE) does not recognize the border radius style in CSS. In order to theme the nested rounded corners in a way that would appear consistent in IE, background images and additional div classes were added to customize the node output.</p>
<p><strong>Drupal's Views Pager:</strong> The design required particular classes needed for custom theming that were not available from the pager's output from Drupal core. A theme override function was created and added to template.php that reformats Drupal's pager output to add the needed classes and remove un-required elements for custom theming.</p>
<p><strong>Video Playlist:</strong> The design for the video playlist required that all items in the playlist view display horizontally. The video module outputs the video feed items into a table and so the items could easily be aligned by floating the table rows left. However IE7 does not recognize floats when applied to table rows. In order to accommodate the CSS limitation with IE7, an alternate display was agreed upon with the client to save time in which a horizontal v. vertical alignment is used for IE7 only.</p>
<p><strong>Drupal's Views Filters and Custom Alpha Pager:</strong> The functional requirements for the view pages needed an Alpha Pager which is not available in Drupal 6 views by default. Also, the design for the search fields and submit buttons required custom theming beyond what is readily available from default Drupal output. Custom functionality using PHP, View Arguments, and custom div classes needed for theming, were created and added into the header for each view that needed an Alpha Pager. To theme Drupal's views search filters to meet the design requirements, CSS is used to position fields and buttons accordingly while also replacing default browser submit buttons with a custom graphic that is consistent in all browsers.</p>
<p><strong>Drop Down Menu Theming:</strong> The design required different visual treatment for non-active drop down menus v. active drop down menus. Non-active drop down states are required to have pink and purple backgrounds while the active dropdown would have a white background. Neither Drupal nor the Nice Menus module output unique classes to identify active v. non-active parent items which are needed to target with CSS for independent theming. Nice Menus module had to be patched to add the first, last, odd and even classes needed for CSS targeting to apply some of the custom theming. In order to add the needed "active" and "non-active" classes to menu's child elements, custom jQuery functionality was created to apply the needed classes dynamically. </p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 15px 30px 15px 0;" id="gmc_recommendedshows" src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/gmc_recommendedshows_v2.jpg" alt="gmc recommended shows" title="gmc recommended shows" name="gmc_recommendedshows" />Every Drupal project should be viewed as a learning experience. Overall, we were able to accomplish key goals and build a powerful, versatile Drupal website that took into account the way gmc was rebranding themselves. The collaborative effort between Mediacurrent and gmc has resulted in a more sophisticated, flexible and professional site. </p>
<p>For project management and ticket tracking, Mediacurrent uses Development Seed’s convenient Drupal distribution, Open Atrium, along with several custom additions including time tracking features. We have been through several PM tools and have been extremely satisfied with Open Atrium. The feature set is akin to what you would find in a more expensive proprietary system, but the flexible Drupal-based system allows us the opportunity to make continued improvements and refinements to the system and how it supports our processes. For example, during the course of this project we customized some of the casetracker-related views to better organize our work around milestones in the project plan.</p>
<p>As with any sizable Drupal implementation, we cannot underscore enough the importance of well-defined site architecture documentation during the planning phase. While most Drupal shops now employ some form of an Agile based methodology, having a roadmap is imperative. In our functional specification document, we incorporated gmc requirements including planned content types, taxonomy, roles, permissions and modules.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the redesign was challenging, yet fun to build. The client’s editors have enjoyed the improved administration features while working with their content. Drupal’s flexibility will allow for continuous and ongoing improvements.</p>

<p>When Drupal 7 was released that meant that Drupal 5 was no longer supported. This announcement is merely a reminder of that fact. It is the policy (and, to large extent a matter of pragmatics) of the Drupal community to support only the current major release of Drupal (currently Drupal 7.x), and the previous release (currently Drupal 6.x). <em>See</em> <a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/version-info">Drupal's version info</a> for more details on this policy.</p>
<h3>Drupal 5 is no longer officially supported</h3>
<p>What does it mean that Drupal 5 is no longer officially supported?</p>
<ol>
<li>You should not expect <a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/drupal?text=&amp;status=Open&amp;priorities=All&amp;categories=All&amp;version=5.x&amp;component=All">any of these issues to be fixed in Drupal core</a>.</li>
<li>The Drupal Security team will no longer solicit nor work to address issues that are reported in the 5.x branch of Drupal core or contributed projects.</li>
<li>The Update Status module, introduced with Drupal 5, relies on XML from drupal.org. That XML is still used for newer versions of the module but may be changed in ways that break the Drupal 5 version of the Update Status module.</li>
</ol>
<p>What does this mean for you?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you are responsible for sites that are running Drupal 5.x</strong>, it's time to upgrade to 6.x or 7.x. See <a href="http://drupal.org/upgrade">instructions on how to upgrade</a> and a <a href="http://drupal.org/videocasts/upgrading-to-6">video on Drupal 5 to Drupal 6 upgrade</a>. Note that 7.x is still relatively young so you may not be able to make that transition just yet.</li>
<li><strong>Module, theme and project maintainers</strong> are encouraged to mark their 5.x versions as unsupported so it is clear to end users that these are no longer supported. You can do that by going to your project, clicking the Edit tab, clicking the Releases sub-tab, and unchecking the boxes for "Supported" in the rows for 5.x releases (screenshots below).</li>
</ul>

<p>You may be thinking "Hey, let's keep Drupal number 5 alive!" You are not alone in this thought process. There is a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-lts">Drupal Long Term Support</a> group devoted to the concept but it has met with limited success so far.</p>
<h3>Thanks, Neil!</h3>
<p>Much like we thanked Gerhard in the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/225729">Drupal 4.7 End Of Life</a>, we'd like to wish Neil Drumm a warm thank you for all his efforts with Drupal 5.</p>

The site provides a social network for birth mothers, on-line counseling support, parent profiles, as well as stories, photos, and videos contributed by IAC birth parents. The site was developed in house using Drupal 6, and was made possible by a grant from the Albert &amp; Elaine Borchard Foundation.</p>
<!--break--><!--break--><h2>Social Support Network</h2>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/iheartadoption2-new.jpg" class="right" />The social networking features of the site give women considering adoption a place to find support and advice from other women who have or are also considering placing their baby in an open adoption. Users can create a profile, make status updates, create blog posts and photo albums, chat with other users, and make new friends. Because this section of the site is accessible only to birth parents, our users can talk openly about their experiences with each other. Using Drupal social communication tools, our counselors are able to engage with their clients in real-time in a non-intrusive way.</p>
<h2>Adoptive Parent Profiles</h2>
<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/issues/iheartadoption3-new.jpg" class="right" />Families working with the IAC can also create profiles on <em>I heart adoption</em>. With these profiles adoptive families can describe themselves in detail, upload photos and letters to birth parents, and link to their website or social networking profiles. Traffic on their profile can be tracked thanks to the Google Analytics module.</p>
<p>Women considering adoption can search and browse these profiles based on their preferences. Searches can be refined by location, family type, religious beliefs, spoken languages, and more.  They can exchange private messages with their favorite families, and flag their favorites for future reference.</p>
<p>This part of the website has proven invaluable for our adoptive families. Getting a website on-line was one of the most difficult steps for many families seeking adoption, and by utilizing the power of Drupal we are now able to offer a quick and simple way to create a web presence.</p>
<h2>Other Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>On-line chat support: Users can chat with our licensed social workers to get answers to all their adoption questions, all without leaving their browser.</li>
<li>Facebook integration: Adoptive families can encourage their friends and families to spread the word by <em>liking</em> their profile.</li>
<li>Due date calculator: Pregnant women can get an estimate of their due date using our calculator widget.</li>
<li>Counselor workflow: Our social workers can monitor the progress of their clients from account creation to publishing their profile, providing feedback along the way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Drupal?</h2>
<p>Once we had developed a plan for all the site features, we began to explore ways to implement it. After contacting a few professional web development shops for quotes and comparing it to our total budget for web and TV advertising, we decided to look at options for developing the site in-house. Doing so would allow us to build the site and have plenty left over for an associated advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Some research on how to build such a site quickly led us to CMSes like Drupal, Plone, DotNetNuke as well as some SAAS options like Ning. It was soon decided that having complete control over the software and the server would be a better long term option for our agency, and so we narrowed the list down to the "big three" of Drupal, WordPress, and Joomla!</p>
<p>With the help of many blog posts and some poking around on <a href="http://cmsmatrix.org/" title="http://cmsmatrix.org/">http://cmsmatrix.org/</a>, Drupal soon emerged as the best option. WordPress was too limited in its abilites, and Joomla! was considered not as SEO friendly. Drupal was given the highest marks by almost every writer we encountered. Ultimately we chose Drupal because it provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A free, open source platform</li>
<li>A secure and highly extensible framework</li>
<li>A large and friendly community for support and guidance</li>
<li>Existing modules for almost every feature we wanted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starting from Scratch</h2>
<p>When we began this project, none of the team had any experience with Drupal (and the developer had only just learned php), so we relied heavily on the extremely helpful Drupal community. The <a href="http://drupal.org/forum">forums</a> were an invaluable resource throughout development, without which this project would not have been possible. Because its a volunteer community we made sure to give back help whenever we could. The <a href="http://drupal.org/forum/22">Post-installation forum</a> is a great place a beginner can help out other beginners, and there is no greater way to learn than to try and teach.</p>
<p>Armed with a copy of <a href="http://frontenddrupal.com/">Front End Drupal</a>, we started development with the theme layer. This turned out to be a great place to begin climbing the Drupal learning-curve. In focusing on the theme, Drupalisms like <em>node</em>, <em>module</em>, and <em>theme hooks</em> began to make more sense. When we were done theming we had a heavily customized user-profile.tpl.php (for parent profiles), and a decent working knowledge of how all the parts of a Drupal site come together. If we could go back, we would use the Content Profile module instead of core profile. On a site focused on profiles like ours, the work would have been greatly simplified if profiles were nodes.</p>
<p>Once the parent profiles were ready, the next big challenge was creating a way for users to search through them. Again, with lots of forum support and a copy of <a href="http://www.drupalbook.com/">Pro Drupal Development</a>, we dove right in. Our search is accomplished by using Drupals Form and Database API's to run queries on user profile fields. In hindsight using Views exposed filters would have worked great here, but our experience with this powerful module was limited, and so we built a custom module to suit our purposes. Several more custom modules were created during this time as well (see list below for details).</p>
<p>By the time we got to the social networking features we felt like pro's. By using the resources in the Drupal community available for little to no cost, we were able to complete this project in-house at a fraction of the cost we were quoted by development shops. It took some extra time and hard work, but for a project with the scope of I Heart Adoption, we felt it was a small sacrifice for a wonderful end product.</p>
<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>I Heart Adoption uses plenty of contributed modules and a few custom ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/user_relationships">User Relationships</a>:</em> Allows birth parents to add families as favorites, and to add each other as friends on the social network.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/facebook_status">Facebook-style Statuses</a> &amp; <a href="http://drupal.org/project/fbssc">Facebook-style Statuses Comment</a>:</em> This fantastic module powers the social network wall together with Views</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/privatemsg">Privatemsg</a>:</em> Lets users send each other messages on the site without disclosing e-mail addresses</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/chatroom">Chatroom</a>:</em> Creates a chatroom node type for real-time chatting on the social network</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/imce">IMCE</a>:</em> A file manager for users, allows our adoptive families to manage their photo albums</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/heartbeat">Heartbeat</a>:</em> Provides a recent activity block, used on our social network</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/flag">Flag</a>:</em> With flag users can “Heart” status updates, blog posts, and photos</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/node_gallery">Node Gallery</a>:</em> Creates gallery and photo content types to allow photo albums on the social network. Because each photo is a node, it can have comments and Heart flags.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/imagecache">Imagecache</a>:</em> Create presets for different image sizes and cache them. An invaluable module for image handling.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/token">Token</a>:</em> Insert data dynamically into content. Mostly works behind the scenes to provide functionality to other modules.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules</a>:</em> An evolved version of the built-in triggers/actions. Lets you define rules to automate site functions, like heartbeat activity messages.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics">Google Analytics</a>:</em> Integration with Google's tracking technology, indispensable for SEO.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a>:</em> Handles display of statuses, should have been used for search feature (see below).</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu">Admin Menu</a>:</em> Keeps site maintainers sane by organizing admin links into a compact drop-down menu.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/nodewords">Node words</a>:</em> Adds meta tag fields to node edit forms, used here for SEO.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/autoassignrole">Auto Assign Role</a>:</em> Gives new accounts a default role, for when you want the default authenticated user to have permissions that other authenticated roles don't have.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/formblock">Form Block</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/remember_me">Remember Me</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/compact_forms">Compact Forms</a>:</em> Makes our user registration  and login forms prettier.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/lightbox2">Lightbox2</a>:</em> Presents content in a lightbox, used for photo presentation.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/menu_per_role">Menu Per Role</a>:</em>  Allows customizing menu items based on role.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/profile_checkboxes">Profile Checkboxes</a>:</em> Can turn select lists into checkboxes, very useful for our data intensive profiles.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/stringoverrides">String Overrides</a>:</em> Easy way to change module output without hacking module code or writing theme functions.</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/unique_avatar">Unique Avatar</a>:</em> Fixes the common caching problem for user pictures (your sites support staff will thank you).</li>
<li><em><a href="http://drupal.org/project/usercomment">User comment</a>:</em> Provides more fine-grained permissions for comments, allows our birthparents to delete comments on their blogs and photos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Custom modules were created for: </p>
<ul>
<li>Searching based on family data. In hindsight Views’ exposed filters would have been ideal for our search, but at the time we were unaware of the power of Views. See my tracker for details on this long, hard road.</li>
<li>The due date calculator. This module adds a block that depends on JavaScript code for its functionality. We already had this script from a previous site, so we decided to use that rather than start with a calendar module from the contributed modules.</li>
<li>A featured family rotation on the front page. This module sets a variable on each cron run with the uid of the profile to be featured (based on various internal metrics). The theme then uses this variable to show the featured profile data.</li>
<li>A module to add captions to photos parents upload in IMCE. It creates a database table to store photo file names, image weight, and caption, and uses the Menu and Form API's so users can edit their photo albums. If we had used nodes for parent profiles and galleries instead of the profile module, there almost certainly would have been a contributed module to accomplish this. In Drupal 7 this is much improved with nodes and users both being entities.</li>
<li>The counselor workflow: Gives counselors advanced search fields, and an interface to review and approve profiles. Queries on profile fields and a call to <code>drupal_mail()</code> make up most of this module. It was built just after our general family search, and writing this module to suit our counseling departments specific procedures proved to be a faster solution than working to integrate a contributed module.</li>
<li>And a general module for site customizations (like form alters and page callbacks).</li>
</ul>
